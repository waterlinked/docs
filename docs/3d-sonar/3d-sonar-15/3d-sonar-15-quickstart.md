## 1. Prepare
Unbox the Sonar 3D-15 and place it in a water container (e.g., a bucket or tank). Avoid getting water on the I/O board.

## 4. Boot the Sonar
Turn on your power supply. Your Sonar 3D-15 takes about 30 seconds to boot.

## 5. Configure your computer’s IP
Assign your computer an IP address in the `192.168.194.x` range (e.g.: `192.168.194.90` with netmask `255.255.255.0`).
!!! Note
    *Configuring network varies between operating systems and versions. Please search the web on how to do this for your operating system. Feel free to contact us for support.*

## 6. Access the Sonar GUI
Open up your web browser (e.g.: Chrome) and enter the fallback IP address `192.168.194.96`. You should now be able to see and use the Sonar 3D-15 GUI.
