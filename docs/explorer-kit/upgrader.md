# Software update

As of software release 2.1.0 the system automatically checks for updates when the host computer is connected to internet. If you have the latest release you will see a green checkmark as shown below. An exclamation mark will indicate if a newer release is available.

![sw_version](../img/sw_version.png)

A software update package (.wlup file) includes all files required to update the system. The software package is encrypted and will only work for the Chip ID it is generated for. The Chip ID can be found in the About tab of the GUI.

## Update process

Please select the update process that is best suited to you:

* If the Underwater GPS GUI is visible to you on [http://192.168.2.94](http://192.168.2.94) please use the [Update with static IP](#update-using-static-ip).
* If the Underwater GPS GUI is not shown when using the link above, please use the [Update with DHCP](#update-using-dhcp).

!!! warning
    The software upgrade will clear the receiver configuration, settings and POIs. Make sure to save the information you need before upgrading.

### Download software package

To get the latest software package for your kit:

* Download directly from the "About" page of the Underwater GPS GUI
* Alternatively: Go to [update.waterlinked.com](https://update.waterlinked.com) and enter the Chip ID of your kit.
