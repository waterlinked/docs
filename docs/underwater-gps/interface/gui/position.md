# Position view

The Underwater GPS GUI is web based. Using your favorite web browser, go the IP address as defined [here](../network-settings.md). We currently support and recommend Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.

!!! Note
    You will need **internet access** on your computer that are showing the GUI if you also want to see the map and not only relative position to the locator. This is because the map is fetched from the internet. 

!!! Attention 
    Internet Explorer is not supported as of now.
