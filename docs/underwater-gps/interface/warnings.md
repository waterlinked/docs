| No external depth received. Is it being sent correctly? | The Underwater GPS is not receiving the depth of the Locator from the ROV.

Details on how the depth is sent to the system can be found [here](../integration/api.md#providing-depth-to-system-when-using-locator-a1). |
| No signal from Locator-U1. Have you selected the correct channel? | Verify that the Locator-U1 is powered on and that it has GPS lock (See [LED signals](../locators/locator-u1.md#led-signals) ). Verify that the same channel is selected on the settings page and the Locator rotary switch. Verify that the Locator and Receivers are in the water |
