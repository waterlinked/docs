| ---------- | :------------ |
| Mode     : | Access Point  |

To connect to the UGPS over it's local wifi
- Power on the UGPS and wait for GPS lock and the Ready LED to be lit.
- Connect to the UnderwaterGPS GUI on: [http://192.168.7.1/](http://192.168.7.1/)

## Ethernet

At power-up, the Master-D1 reads the IP switch settings. The ethernet network mode depends on the switch position.

| Network mode             | Direction            | IP switch position |
| ------------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Configurable             | UP                   | ![](../img/IP_switch_configurable.png) |
| Static IP 192.168.194.94 | DOWN                 | ![](../img/IP_switch_static_192.png) |

### Configurable mode
In the configurable mode the UGPS will receive an IP adress from the local router and can be reached on the assigned IP address.

### Fallback or static IP
The UGPS can always be reached on its static IP adress. 

Before turning the UGPS on:

- Connect the UGPS ethernet directly to your computer
- Set the switch in the static IP position 

Then:

- Power on the UGPS and wait for GPS lock and the Ready LED to be lit.
- Configure your computer to static IP on the same subnet as the UGPS.
For example: If the IP address of the UGPS is 192.168.194.94 the host computer needs to be configured to a different 192.168.194.x address e.g. 192.168.194.100.
- Connect to the UnderwaterGPS GUI on: [http://192.168.194.94/](http://192.168.194.94/)

!!! Note
With blueOS the static IP is 192.168.2.94
