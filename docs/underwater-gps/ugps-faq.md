## 1. The heading are drifting rapidly
In dynamic environments, such as in a boat at sea with rapid change of angles, the heading has to be set frequently in [Settings](../underwater-gps/interface/ugps-gui.md#settings). In harsh wether this has to be done up to every minute. In such conditions it is advised to use an external compass to get accurate positioning data from the UGPS. If the UGPS is permanently installed on one boat, the boats compass can be used. Otherwise an [external portable compass](../underwater-gps/integration/external-gps.md) can be implemented.

## 2. Can I set the speed of sound?
Yes, If you have the R300 version you can set the speed of sound in the "settings" menu in the GUI.

!!! Note
    If you have the R100 version you can't change the speed of sound. The option to change the speed of sound is still present, but you will get an error message saying "Bad request"

## 3. My UGPS system are not performing well
If your UGPS system does not perform as expected, you should contact Waterlinkes tecnical support team through the [support portal](https://waterlinked.com/support) in Waterlinked's home pages on the internet.

To help the support team analyzing your systems behaviour, you should record a diagnostic logfile. This can easily be done by opening the Diagnostics window in the UGPS GUI. At the bottom of the page there is an option that allows you to record a diagnostic report. The file should preferably be recorded in the moment or circumstance as your system is failing. Attach the diagnostic report file you recorded to your request. The file contains valuable information that will help the support team analyse your system. 


!!! Note
    The logfile must be downloaded to your computer and sent to customer support as an attachment.
