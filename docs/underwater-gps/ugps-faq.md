## 1. Can I set the speed of sound?
Yes, If you have the R300 version you can set the speed of sound in the "settings" menu in the GUI.

!!! Note
    If you have the R100 version you can't change teh speed of sound. The option to change the speed of sound is still present, but you will get an error message saying "Bad request"
