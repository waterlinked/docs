## Description

The Locator-U1 is a battery-powered, digital hydroacoustic locator device. It includes an internal GPS-based time-sync module, eliminating the need for a tether. This makes it ideal for divers, ROVs lacking convenient power sources, or other underwater applications.

Before deployment, the Locator-U1 must obtain a GPS lock. The integrated status LED indicates the lock status. Once locked, the Locator-U1 can operate for around 6 hours before it needs to resync with GPS.

A rotary switch is located inside the cap, allowing you to select the channel on which the Locator transmits. The same channel must be set in the Water Linked Underwater GPS GUI. Each side of the Locator has three M3 mounting holes, and a standard bracket is included.

!!! Note
    You will need GPS lock on the topside as well when using the U1. This is for timing purposes, it will not help to use only external GPS position as this can not be used for time synchronization. It is not enough to only have GPS lock on the U1.

## Charging

The Locator-U1 has an internal rechargeable battery. Use the included USB-C cable and a 5 V / 2 A (or higher) wall adapter to charge it. The U1 will require to be fully charged before each operation as it will discharge over time when left with the cap off. Depending on the age of the U1 and the temperature in the environment the discharging effect will be worse. 

1) **Insert the USB-C cable**  
   Plug one end of the cable into the Locator-U1’s charging port.

2) **Connect to a suitable power source**  
   Attach the other end of the cable to a wall adapter providing at least 2 A.  
   Avoid charging from a computer USB port.

3) **Charge for 7 hours**  
   Leave the Locator-U1 connected for a full 7 hours to ensure a complete charge. You can then disconnect the cable and use the Locator-U1.

### LED Behavior While Charging

When the Locator-U1 is connected to a charger, the LED does not indicate charging progress. You may see:

1) **Blinking green LED**  
   The Locator-U1 is powered on and functioning normally (such as searching for GPS). This does **not** reflect charging status.

2) **No LED (off)**  
   The battery is too low to power on, but the device is still charging. Once it has enough power, the LED will start blinking.

3) **Solid green LED**  
   The Locator-U1 is powered on and has a GPS lock (see [LED Signals](#led-signals)). This does **not** mean it is fully charged. Keep charging for the full 7-hour period.

!!! warning
    Do not charge the Locator-U1 using a computer USB port.

## Powering On and Off

- **To power on** the Locator-U1, securely tighten the lid over the charging port. The LED will begin blinking to indicate that it is searching for a GPS lock. Once the LED stops blinking and becomes solid, the Locator-U1 has acquired a GPS lock and is ready for use.  
  Ensure the O-ring on the lid is undamaged before submerging the device.

- **To power off** the Locator-U1, unscrew the back lid until the LED turns off.

## LED Signals

- **No green light**  
  Power is off; the Locator-U1 is not ready for diving.

- **Flashing green light (once per second)**  
  The Locator-U1 is searching for a GPS lock and is not ready to dive.

- **Fixed green light**  
  The Locator-U1 has a GPS lock and is ready to dive.

- **Flashing green light (slow)**  
  The Locator-U1 previously had a GPS lock but lost it. It is still ready to dive.

- **Fast flashing green light (multiple times per second)**  
  Error indication. The Locator-U1 is not ready to dive. This often happens if the device has exceeded its dive time and the pressure sensor requires drying. Charging the Locator helps to dry the sensor more quickly.

!!! warning
    The Locator-U1 can only be submerged for about 6 hours. It then requires time to dry the pressure sensor in order to provide accurate depth readings.

## Wiring Interface

Since the Locator-U1 is battery powered, its only interface is the charging port, which is a standard USB-C connector.
