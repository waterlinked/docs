## Connector Setup
**Testing the Sonar 3D-15 Separately**

If the I/O Interface board is attached, the Sonar 3D-15 can be tested directly using an Ethernet cable and a power supply. If you wish to test the device on its own before integration, follow the general Quickstart tutorial, available here:  [Quickstart](https://docs.waterlinked.com/sonar-3d/sonar-3d-15-quickstart/).

**Connecting to Chasing ROV**

The most common solution is to terminate a Chasing connector to the cable of the Sonar 3D-15. To do this, we recommend the following procedure:


1. **Remove the I/O board** After this step, the I/O board is no longer needed for normal operation. 

2. **Terminate a Chasing connector** to the Sonar 3D-15 cable using the table below.

    | Sonar Cable Type | Sonar Cable Color | CHASING connector male |
    |------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
    | DC-              | Black             | 1                       |
    | DC+              | Red               | 2                       |
    | RX+              | Green/White       | 6                       |
    | RX-              | Green             | 5                       |
    | TX+              | Orange/White      | 4                       |
    | TX-              | Orange            | 3                       |
    | NC               | NC                | 7                       |

    The following is a picture of the pins for the male Chasing connector face:

3. **Add a waterproof seal** around the termination.

!!! note
    The termination has to be waterproof and needs to withstand the depths of which you will be running your ROV. 

---


## Mounting 
The Sonar 3D-15 needs to be physically attached to the Chasing ROV. A possible option on how to do this will be listed here. There are many different approaches to achieve this, and this approach is only listed to provide an idea.

1. **Create or find a suitable mount**

    An example 3D step file of a mount is found here: [Download 3D step file](./stp_files/WL-21045-2--Chasing-M2-Pro-Max-Mount--v2.stp)
    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/mount.jpg)

    !!! Note
        Choose a 3D print material that can withstand the expected operating conditions.

2. **Identify the screws and mount to use**

    The four screw holes on the Sonar 3D-15 are sized `[M4x0.7-6H 5.0 DEEP]`. Choose a screw to fit this in addition to your chosen mount. Use a M4 Washer if necessary. For the Mounting Bracket plate, M3 screws is needed.
    
    For the example mount *(as the given 3D print file)*, the following screws and washers are sufficient:
    
    - 4x `M3x6.0mm ISO 14583 A4` screws
    - 4x `M4x12mm ISO 14583 A4` screws
    - 4x `M4 ISO 7089 A4` Washers  

    !!!Warning
        To avoid damaging the Sonar 3D-15, make sure the screws are not too long.

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/M3x6.jpg){width="32%"}

3. **Attach the CHASING Quick Mounting Bracket plate to the Mount**

    Attach the CHASING Quick Mounting Bracket plate to the Mount like in the images below, using the M3 screws that was provided when purchased from Chasing.

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/quick_on_mount.jpg){width="49%"}

4. **Attach the mount to the Sonar 3D-15**

    We recommend attaching the Sonar 3D-15 to the attachment rail underneath at the front of the Chasing, so that the Sonar 3D-15’s field of view is not obstructed.

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/sonar_and_mount.jpg){width="49%"}
    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/how_to_place_washer.jpg){width="49%"}
    !!! Tip
        Attach buoyancy module to the top attachment rail on the front to counteract the additional downward force caused by the Sonar 3D-15.

5. **Attach the mounted Sonar 3D-15 to the Chasing ROV** 

    Use the CHASING Mounting Bracket to attach the mounted Sonar 3D-15 to the ROV.

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/quick_holder.jpg){width="49%"} 
    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/sonar_attatched.jpg){width="49%"} 

!!! note
    Make sure the Sonar 3D-15 and cable is neatly and securely attached before use.

## Connection steps

### 1. **Connect the cable**

Connect the Sonar 3D-15 cable into one of the free ethernet ports on the Chasing.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/net_port_chasing.jpg)



### 2. **Turn on the ROV**
Use the power switch on the Chasing controller and let the ROV boot up. This activates the Chasing Wi-Fi network.


!!! Warning
    To avoid potential power hazard or errors, make sure every cable is well connected before you turn on the controller. Do not connect sensors to the Chasing while the power is on.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/cortroller_chasing.jpg)


### 3. **Add the Sonar 3D-15 device**

Connect your phone to the Chasing Wi-Fi network from the Wi-Fi settings on your phone. Go into the CHASING GO1 app to activate the ROV. Your device will likely prompt you to confirm the connection since the Wi-Fi has no internet access. You must accept this to proceed.

Enter CHASING GO1 and click on the puzzle piece in the bottom right. Here we will add the Sonar 3D-15 as an external device.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/pusslepiece_chasing.png)

Select **"Click to Add Accessories"** on the Network port the Sonar 3D-15 is connected to.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/Screenshot_chasing_app_1.png)

Click **"Other accessories"**.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/Screenshot_chasing_app_2.png)


Now the Sonar 3D-15 will be powered and assigned an IP-address by the Chasing ROV.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/Screenshot_chasing_app_3.png)



!!! Note
    If the green light at the front of the Sonar 3D-15 is on, the Sonar 3D-15 is receiving power. 



### 4. **Access the Sonar 3D-15 GUI**
The Sonar 3D-15 GUI is accessed by entering the Sonar 3D-15's IP-address into the browser running on any device connected to the Chasing Wi-Fi. 

!!!Note
    We recomend operating the Sonar 3D-15 GUI on a seperate device so that you can view the sonar while continuing to operate the ROV as usual on the main ROV controller display; typically your smartphone.

Both the device and Chasing need to have DHCP enabled. This is standard for most computers and phones and is normally enabled. To check if your computer has DHCP enabled, do the following:

---

#### Checking DHCP 

**--> Windows - Option 1:**

1. Open **Settings** > **Network & Internet**.
2. Click on **Ethernet**
3. Select your active connection.
4. Scroll to IP settings:
    - If it says **Automatic (DHCP)** → it's enabled. 
    - If it says **Manual** → DHCP is off.

**--> Windows - Option 2:**

1. Run the following command in the Windows terminal
```sh 
ipconfig /all 
```

2. Look for the section **Ethernet adapter Ethernet** and the line **DHCP Enabled** (green arrow)

3. If **DHCP Enabled** is set to **Yes**, then DHCP is enabled.

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-deeptrekkerpivot/check_dhcp_windows.png)

---

**--> Linux:**

1. Run the following in the terminal:

```sh 
for iface in $(ip -o link show | awk -F': ' '{print $2}'); do
  echo "Interface: $iface"
  ip addr show "$iface" | grep -q dynamic && echo "  --> DHCP detected" || echo "  --> Static or unknown"
done

```


If you see **--> DHCP detected**, your PC has DHCP enabled and you are ready to continue.

If DHCP is disabled, please enable this on your computer. 


---

#### Determining the IP-address

Once you have assured that your device is using DHCP, you need to determine which IP-address has been automatically assigned to the Sonar 3D-15 by the Chasing system. Once located, entering it in your browser displays a page like the one below — in this example, the Sonar 3D-15 is assigned the IP-address `192.168.1.21`.

![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/chasing_sonar_gui.png){width="30%"}

!!! Warning
    To avoid overheating, **do not click the green button “Enable Acoustics”** until the ROV is submerged in water.
    
    Acoustics is always disabled when first booting up the Sonar 3D-15, and will be turned on once this button is clicked. The Sonar 3D-15 will automatically turn itself off if too hot, but will take some time to cool down, it's best to avoid this happening.




Find the IP-address corresponding to the Sonar 3D-15 on a computer by doing the following:

1. **Get an overview of the network**

    **--> On a computer**

    You need the network IP-address of your computer on the Chasing network. 
    On **Linux** you find it by typing in:

    ```sh
    ip a
    ```
    in the terminal. 
    
    On **Windows** you find it by typing in:
    ```sh
    ipconfig
    ```
    !!!Tip
        It's easier to find your IP-address if your computer is connected only to the Chasing network.

    A quick easy way to see the IP-addresses of the devices on your local network is to use [nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html). Install it for your operating system and go to the terminal and write
    ```sh
    nmap -sn <YOUR_IP>
    ```

    This will scan the Chasing Wi-Fi and show all accessible connected devices and their IPs.

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/nmap_output_chasing.png)

    **--> On a smartphone**

    WiFiman by Ubiquiti is a good and free option to perform an IP-scan and find all accessible IP-addresses on the network. It can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubnt.usurvey&pcampaignid=web_share) or [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ubiquiti-wifiman/id1385561119). 

    !!! Note
        There are many options of apps and programs that can perform a IP-scan of the network. Fing is another app that works well.

    Once installed and inside the WiFiman app, go to **Discovery** and scan the network. A list of all connected devices on the network will show, similar to the following:

    ![Pixels](../img/sonar3d-integration-chasing/chasing_wifiman.png){width="30%"}

2. **Test and find the IP-address**

    To find the IP-address of the Sonar 3D-15, try the IP-addresses on the list by typing them into the search bar of your browser. 

    - For example, if you have the list above, try `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.1.20`, `192.168.1.21` and so on. You may try them all safely.

    If the Sonar 3D-15 GUI appears, you have found the correct IP-address.

!!! Tip
    It is possible to access the GUI on the Sonar 3D-15's fallback address `192.168.194.96`. This method is explained in more detail on the general quickstart guide, which can be found at [Quickstart](https://docs.waterlinked.com/sonar-3d/sonar-3d-15-quickstart/) .


### 5. **Put the ROV in water**

You are now ready to put the ROV in water.
