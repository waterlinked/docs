## 3. Connect a power supply and boot the Sonar
- Connect your power supply to the I/O board. Use a power supply capable of delivering 60W (surge) at 10-30V (20+ V recommended).
- Turn on your power supply. Your Sonar 3D-15 takes about 30 seconds to boot.

## 4. Configure your computer’s IP
Assign your computer an IP address in the `192.168.194.x` range (e.g.: `192.168.194.90` with netmask `255.255.255.0`).
!!! Note
    *Configuring network varies between operating systems and versions. Please search the web on how to do this for your operating system. Feel free to contact us for support.*
