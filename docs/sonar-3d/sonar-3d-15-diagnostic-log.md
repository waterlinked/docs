# How to take a Diagnostic Log
A diagnostic log is one of the most important tools we have for helping you. 
It allows us to:

- Check the health and performance of the sonar.

- Analyse the acoustic environment the sonar is operating in.

- Identify issues related to noise, reflections, and installation.

Submerge the Sonar 3D-15 in water and make sure the front of the Sonar 3D-15 is ideally 0.5m - 2m away from any wall or solid object. 

You can acquire this in the **UI > Settings > "Go to sonar config" Button > "Diagnostics" Tab > Diagnostic Log**.
