# How to take a Diagnostic Log
If you experience problems with the Sonar 3D-15 that might be related to the hardware and want to submit a support ticket it will be helpful to send us a diagnostic log of your sonar.

You can acquire this in the UI > Settings > "Go to sonar config" Button > "Diagnostics" Tab > Diagnostic Log.
