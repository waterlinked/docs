# Serial Interface

This document describes how to configure and operate the underwater modem via its serial interface. The modem can be controlled using a 3.3V UART or RS422 connection, offering two primary operational modes (transparent serial and diagnostic), various power levels, and user-selectable communication channels.

## Serial Interface Overview

The modem implements a half-duplex serial protocol with the following default configuration:

- **Baud rate:** 9600 bps  
- **Data bits:** 8  
- **Stop bits:** 1  
- **Parity:** None  

Users can switch between **3.3V TTL UART** or **RS422** for physical interfacing. Through this serial link, you can:

- Set operational modes  
- Change communication channels  
- Request diagnostic reports  
- Adjust power levels for transmission range/power consumption  

---

## Operational Modes

The modem supports two main operational modes:

1. **Transparent Serial Mode**  
   - Processes and transmits only **2 bytes** of data per packet.  
   - Each transmission takes ~1.6 seconds (acoustic wave duration).  
   - Data beyond the first 2 bytes in a transmission is discarded.

2. **Diagnostic Mode**  
   - Sends detailed status reports, including:  
     - Transport Block (TB)  
     - Bit Error Rate (BER)  
     - Signal & Noise Power  
     - LDPC/CRC Validity  
     - Firmware Revision  
     - Time Since Power-Up  
     - FPGA Chip ID, Hardware Revision  
     - Communication Channel  
     - TX-Complete Status  
     - Power Level Setting  
   - Still limited to **2 bytes** of payload per transmission (discarding any additional data).  
   - Reports are triggered automatically when:
     1. A new packet is received (TB Valid bit is set)  
     2. A transmission completes (TX Complete bit is set)  
     3. 4 seconds have elapsed since the last report  

!!! note
    You can also request a **diagnostic report** while in transparent mode. See the [Request Report Command](#request-report-command) section.

---

## Quickstart Guide

By default:

- **Operational Mode:** Transparent serial mode  
- **Communication Channel:** 1  

For a simple point-to-point setup with two modems:  
1. Connect each modem (via UART or RS422).  
2. Ensure both are set to the same **channel** (default is 1).  
3. Begin sending data; the modems will relay up to 2 bytes each ~1.6 seconds.

---

## Settings Interface

You can configure the modem by issuing commands over the serial link. Four user-configurable parameters are available:

1. **Communication Channel**  
2. **Operation Mode**  
3. **Report Request**  
4. **Power Level**

Each configuration command requires sending specific characters with a 1-second pause between them, followed by a character that selects the new value. Refer to the relevant section below.

---

### Communication Channel Command

The modem can operate on **12 channels** (1 to 12). Two modems must share the same channel to communicate.

**Procedure:**

1. Send `"c"` (0x63).  
2. Wait **1 second**.  
3. Send another `"c"` (0x63).  
4. Within **2 seconds**, send **one character** (`"1"`–`"c"`) to set the desired channel.

| **Channel** | **Character** | **HEX-Value** |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1          | "1"           | 0x31          |
| 2          | "2"           | 0x32          |
| 3          | "3"           | 0x33          |
| 4          | "4"           | 0x34          |
| 5          | "5"           | 0x35          |
| 6          | "6"           | 0x36          |
| 7          | "7"           | 0x37          |
| 8          | "8"           | 0x38          |
| 9          | "9"           | 0x39          |
| 10         | "a"           | 0x61          |
| 11         | "b"           | 0x62          |
| 12         | "c"           | 0x63          |

**Example (Channel 11):**
1. Send `"c"`  
2. Wait 1 second  
3. Send `"c"` again  
4. Within 2 seconds, send `"b"` (0x62)  

---

### Setting Operational Mode

To toggle between **diagnostic mode** and **transparent serial mode**:

1. Send `"m"` (0x6D).  
2. Wait **1 second**.  
3. Send `"m"` again.  

The modem will switch modes (e.g., if you were in transparent mode, it will switch to diagnostic).

---

### Setting Power Level

To adjust the modem’s power level (1–4):

1. Send `"l"` (0x6C).  
2. Wait **1 second**.  
3. Send `"l"` again.  
4. Within 2 seconds, send one character (`"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`, or `"4"`).

| **Power Level** | **Character** | **HEX-Value** | **Avg. TX Power (mW)** | **Typical Max Range (m)** |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| 1              | "1"           | 0x31          | 390                    | 300                       |
| 2              | "2"           | 0x32          | 555                    | 600                       |
| 3              | "3"           | 0x33          | 790                    | 900                       |
| 4 (Default)    | "4"           | 0x34          | 1105                   | 1000                      |

!!! note
    Maximum range is highly dependent on environmental factors, including noise levels and line-of-sight conditions between modems.

**Example (Set Power Level 3):**
1. Send `"l"` (0x6C).  
2. Wait 1 second.  
3. Send `"l"` (0x6C) again.  
4. Within 2 seconds, send `"3"` (0x33).  

---

### Request Report Command

In **both** diagnostic and transparent modes, you can request a report at any time:

1. Send `"r"` (0x72).  
2. Wait **1 second**.  
3. Send `"r"` (0x72) again.

The modem will immediately generate a diagnostic report.

---

## Packet Structure of the Diagnostic Report

When in diagnostic mode (or upon a report request in transparent mode), the modem sends an **18-byte** report. The byte layout is:

| **Byte (bit)** | **Field**              | **Description**                                                                                 |

!!! Warning
    **Signal Power:** This value represents the strength of the signal received by the modem when it is decoding a data packet. It ranges from 0 to 255, where 255 is the strongest signal (ideal conditions), and lower values indicate weaker signals. Importantly, when the modem is idle and not decoding or sending data, the signal power will represent the background noise, known as the "noise floor." This is because the modem is not detecting any signal during idle periods.

    **Noise Power:** This value represents the background noise in the environment. When the modem is idle, the noise power and signal power will be the same, both representing the noise floor. During packet decoding, the noise power may increase due to interference, energy leakage, or other environmental factors, but this will only be noticeable when data is being processed. The signal power should always exceed the noise power when data of sufficient quality is being received for decoding.

    **Summary:** It's essential to note that when the modem is idle, the signal power and noise power will be identical, representing the noise floor. Therefore, you cannot directly compare these values when the modem is idle. To assess the environment, store the noise power while the modem is idle (as the noise floor) and compare it with the signal power during packet decoding. A higher signal power compared to the stored noise floor indicates a better communication setup and environment.

### Example Python Report Parser

```python
def decode_packet(packet: bytes) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Decode a packet received from the modem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    packet : bytes
        The raw packet (18 bytes) starting with '$' (0x24) and ending with '\n' (0x0A).

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        A dictionary with decoded values if valid, or None otherwise.
    """
    if len(packet) != 18 or packet[0] != ord('$') or packet[-1] != ord('\n'):
        return None

    # The 16 bytes after the '$' and before the '\n'
    data = packet[1:17]
    decoded = struct.unpack("<HBBBHBBBBBHBB", data)

    decoded_dict = {
        "TR_BLOCK": decoded[0],
        "BER": decoded[1],
        "SIGNAL_POWER": decoded[2],
        "NOISE_POWER": decoded[3],
        "PACKET_VALID": decoded[4],
        "PACKET_INVALID": decoded[5],
        "GIT_REV": decoded[6].to_bytes(1, "little"),
        "TIME": (decoded[9] << 16) | (decoded[8] << 8) | decoded[7],
        "CHIP_ID": decoded[10],
        "HW_REV": decoded[11] & 0b00000011,
        "CHANNEL": (decoded[11] & 0b00111100) >> 2,
        "TB_VALID": (decoded[11] & 0b01000000) >> 6,
        "TX_COMPLETE": (decoded[11] & 0b10000000) >> 7,
        "DIAGNOSTIC_MODE": decoded[12] & 0b00000001,
        "LEVEL": (decoded[12] & 0b00001100) >> 2,
    }

    return decoded_dict
```

## Ensuring Successful Transmission & Optimization

### Diagnostic Mode
A report is sent immediately after each transmission.  
Monitor the **TX_COMPLETE** bit in the report to know when the modem is ready for the next 2-byte packet. This approach maximizes overall throughput.

### Transparent Serial Mode
Send 2 bytes, then wait at least **1.6 seconds** (the transmission duration) before sending the next 2 bytes to avoid data loss.

---

## Flash Memory Considerations
Changing the **modem mode**, **channel**, or **power level** initiates a **flash write operation**, which takes about **1 second**. During this time:

- The modem will **not respond** to commands.  
- **Do not power off** the modem to avoid corrupting settings.

Once the flash write completes, the modem resumes normal operation with the updated configuration.
