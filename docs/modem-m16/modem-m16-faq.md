**Q1: Can the M16 modem measure the range/distance between two modems?**

**A1:** No, the modem's uses an unsynchronized method of sending data meaning that an time of flight estimate would give large errors in the range estimations. The acoustic signal is not synced but known to be within some time frame of 25ms.
