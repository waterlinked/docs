It has a relatively high update rate and dynamic. For the calculation of an absolute position, the velocities have to be integrated over time with the help of inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Furthermore, the user has to specify a starting position of this dead-reckoning-algorithm. Alternatively a normal GPS can be used to initialize the position prior to a dive. One advantage of using a DVL only is that no infrastructure outside the ROV (such as antennas, beacons, etc.) is needed. As a downside, small errors in sensor values accumulate over time and the position estimate drifts from the actual position. A typical use case for the DVL is station keeping even in water currents. It also helps to track the approximate ROV position on a map and enables simple autonomous missions. Capabilities of the Underwater GPS as a Standalone System The Water Linked Underwater GPS is able to provide an absolute position below water. It is based on the combination of a standard GPS to measure the Topside position and the Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning to determine the ROV/locator position relative to the Topside. The characteristic of this combined position estimate is that it is global, with little to no drift over time under the right conditions. The update rate is in general lower compared to the DVL. A typical use case for using the Underwater GPS by itself is to visualize the ROV position on a map for manual control and finding a specific geolocation below water. Enhanced Functionality with Combined DVL and UGPS Integration When both sensor types are combined in a good manner they can compensate each other's weak sides. For instance the UGPS helps to compensate for the position drift of the DVL over time. The DVL on the other hand increases the update rate of the position, which is necessary for better control. This is particularly useful if you want to use the positioning not only for visualization during manual operation or position holding but longer autonomous missions (e.g. waypoint navigation). Below section \"Mode DVL+UGPS\" describes how to enable this in the BlueROV control system. Mode \"DVL+UGPS\": Fusing the data of Underwater GPS and DVL for a position estimate of the BlueROV The BlueROV uses a highly-customizable autopilot Ardusub . One part of that autopilot is an Extended Kalman filter, which is able to combine inputs from all types of sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, pressure sensor, GPS, DVL, etc.) to calculate a position estimate. This is then used to either simply show the position on a map in manual mode or as part of a feedback loop to actively control the ROV. This data fusion algorithm is not part of a Water Linked product but is executed in the BlueROV control system. So the user is in full control of the parameters and used algorithm. Before successful sensor fusion of Underwater GPS and DVL the following conditions must be met: A BlueROV running BlueOS with a version 1.1.0 (stable) or newer. The DVL is installed, configured and tested successfully. Guides can be found here and on the Blue Robotics website Make sure you are running version 1.0.7 or newer of the BlueOS Water Linked DVL extension . The extension version can be checked / updated in BlueOS by going to Extensions > Installed. The version is shown next to the extension name, see below figure. The Underwater GPS is installed, configured and tested successfully. The latest UGPS integration-guide can be found here . Make sure you are running version 1.0.7 or newer of the BlueOS Water Linked UGPS extension . The accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and pressure sensor must be calibrated: Calibration of all sensors can be performed from QGroundControl. Detailed steps are described in the BlueROV Software Setup Make sure that the compass calibration was successful by comparing the ROV orientation shown in the map in QGroundControl to the actual ROV orientation. Land-marks like a coast-line or an analogue compass can help. Note When you want to use the position estimate for control of the ROV and the UGPS Topside is on land, it is highly recommended setting up the Underwater GPS to use static position and static heading mode. Alternatively when the UGPS Topside position is not static (on a boat or similar) you need to input heading and position data from an external GPS compass. Details can be found here . If you don't follow this advice, the position provided by the Underwater GPS will have more noise (\"jump\" too much) and also drift over time. This might cause the position hold mode to not work properly. The Underwater GPS together with the BlueOS UGPS extension provide a standard deviation of the global position to the autopilot and the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter uses this standard deviation to weight the provided position in relation to other sensor inputs. The standard deviation is currently optimized for static position and static heading mode. The steps to enable sensor fusion are: To enable fusion of Underwater GPS and DVL, enable both the \"Water Linked DVL\"-extension and \"Water Linked UGPS\"-extension in the extensions manager. You see that they are running when an uptime is shown. Open the interface of the DVL extension and click the button \"Load parameters for DVL+UGPS\". This will set parameters for the Kalman filter to consider both sensors. Those parameters are persistent over reboots, which means that this button only needs to be pressed once and not every time you restart the ROV. Restart the autopilot for the parameter changes to take effect. It is not necessary to reboot BlueOS. If both Underwater GPS and DVL are connected, it is not necessary to set the vehicle position manually in the DVL extension. Now both sensors should be considered for the position estimate of the ROV. You can test this in a simple way by switching the ROV to position hold mode around close (e.g. 3 m) to the UGPS-antenna and in sight. The ROV should stand still. When you now slowly turn the UGPS antenna, the ROV should follow your rotation. Alternative mode \"DVL only\": How to base the ROV position estimate only on the DVL while the Underwater GPS is running This mode can be useful when you experience issues with sensor fusion (Mode \"DVL+UGPS\" above) or not all the described conditions in above section are met. Otherwise, we recommend using Mode \"DVL+UGPS\". In this configuration the BlueROV will base its position estimate updates on velocity input from the DVL as well as accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and pressure sensor but not the Underwater GPS. Although the Underwater GPS is connected and running it will only be used to initialize the global ROV position at the beginning. QGroundControl (or the new Cockpit) will show the ROV position estimate based on the DVL only while the Underwater GPS GUI will show the position based on the Underwater GPS. Note The setup procedure below is very similar to when you only use the DVL without a running Underwater GPS. That case is described here . Enable both the \"Water Linked DVL\"-extension and \"Water Linked UGPS\"-extension in the extensions manager. You see that they are running when an uptime is shown. Make sure you use the latest versions of both extensions. Open the interface of the DVL-extension and click the button \"Load parameters for DVL\". This will set parameters for the Kalman filter to ignore the Underwater GPS input. Those parameters are persistent over reboots, which means that this button only needs to be pressed once and not every time you restart the ROV. Restart the autopilot for the parameter changes to take effect. It is not necessary to reboot BlueOS. If both Underwater GPS and DVL are connected, it is not necessary to set the vehicle position manually in the DVL extension. FAQ for sensor fusion of Underwater GPS and DVL How do I start an autonomous mission? Blue Robotics wrote a guide on how to start an autonomous mission with the DVL only . The steps are the same when you use DVL and Underwater GPS together after you followed above guide for Mode \"DVL+UGPS\". At the time of writing (November 2024) QGroundControl is still more suited for advanced usage like missions compared to the new Cockpit. Which mode am I currently using? Is Underwater GPS input enabled for sensor fusion or not? You can check if the correct parameters are set by navigating to \"Autopilot Parameters\" in BlueOS. It shows a searchable list of all currently set parameters. Below table lists both default values of the parameters for two Ardusub versions and which values the DVL extension sets when you click on the respective buttons. The parameter set by the Underwater GPS extension is listed, too. Parameters can be \"not set\" which is shown as an empty cell in the table.

Some parameters in Ardusub require a reboot of the autopilot to take effect while others take effect immediately. If in doubt, reboot the autopilot. The ROV moves back and forth in position hold mode. What is wrong? When the ROV holds its position well in mode \"DVL only\" and starts moving back and forth in mode \"DVL+UGPS\" this is due to more than expected noise of the UGPS position. Make sure to use static position and heading of the Underwater GPS Topside for best results. How does the sensor fusion work? This section is for advanced users and developers who try to understand what happens behind the scenes. It contains links to documentation of the relevant open source projects and describes how Water Linked products interact. The DVL and UGPS extensions are sending messages following the mavlink-protocol to the autopilot, e.g. the message GPS_INPUT. The ROV-specific autopilot is called Ardusub , which is part of a larger project Ardupilot The extended Kalman filter is described in the Ardupilot documentation . The EKF3 implementation is used by default. In the current version of Ardusub together with the navigator flight controller only one EKF-lane is used. How the BlueOS Water Linked DVL extension interacts with the autopilot This figure illustrates which events trigger which function calls and which mavlink messages: When the user sets the vehicle location on the extension map the first time, the origin of the autopilot global position estimate is set (SET_GPS_GLOBAL_ORIGIN). When the latter is already set, the position estimate is updated with GLOBAL_VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE. The main input from the DVL to the autopilot is the mavlink message VISION_POSITION_DELTA. It contains the change of position and attitude since the last message in body frame of the ROV together with the time interval since the last measurement. This corresponds directly to velocities and angular rates. The figure of merit (FOM) provided by the DVL is scaled to a confidence value in percent. The DVL-internal dead-reckoning exposed through the position_local-TCP-packet is currently not used on a BlueROV. A function in the extension is implemented, but it is disabled. So GLOBAL_VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE messages are sent based on DVL-measurements. The attitude measured by the DVL-IMU (current_attitude) is sent in the VISION_POSITION_DELTA-message. The attitude values sent in VISION_POSITION_DELTA are currently not considered by the Ardusub autopilot. More details can be found in the source code in the GitHub repository . How the BlueOS Water Linked UGPS extension interacts with the autopilot This is an overview figure of the sent mavlink messages: The main input from the Underwater GPS to the autopilot is the mavlink message GPS_INPUT. The GitHub README provides more details.","title":"DVL with UGPS for BlueROV2"},{"location":"dvl/bluerov-integration-dvl-ugps/#optimizing-performance-when-concurrently-using-our-dvl-and-ugps-systems","text":"","title":"Optimizing Performance when concurrently using our DVL and UGPS Systems"},{"location":"dvl/bluerov-integration-dvl-ugps/#capabilities-of-the-dvl-as-a-standalone-system","text":"The Water Linked DVL can provide accurate velocities relative to the seabed.

This corresponds directly to velocities and angular rates. The figure of merit (FOM) provided by the DVL is scaled to a confidence value in percent. The DVL-internal dead-reckoning exposed through the position_local-TCP-packet is currently not used on a BlueROV. A function in the extension is implemented, but it is disabled. So GLOBAL_VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE messages are sent based on DVL-measurements. The attitude measured by the DVL-IMU (current_attitude) is sent in the VISION_POSITION_DELTA-message. The attitude values sent in VISION_POSITION_DELTA are currently not considered by the Ardusub autopilot.

To minimize the time between receipt of a DVL and having it up and running, the DVLs are shipped with an attached I/O interface, providing ease of connectivity with power, ethernet and serial. However, for most ROVs and AUVs, the DVL has to be integrated with the on-board electronics through a penetrator or a subsea connector. This guide details how the DVL-A50 can be integrated with the BlueROV2. Exactly the same procedure can be carried out for the DVL-A125 . Parts and tools What parts and tools needed depends on whether you intend to permanently attach the DVL-A50 to the BlueROV2, have it semi-permanently attached, or use a subsea connector for quick installation/removal. This guide details how to permanently attach the DVL-A50 to a BlueROV2. You will need DVL-A50 BlueROV2 Small ethernet switch. The one pictured here is from BlueRobotics , and ideal for use in the BlueROV2. DVL-A50 Bracket . This is optional, but protects the DVL-A50 and allows for down to 0 cm minimum altitude. You will also need: Hex Key Set from Blue Robotics Bulkhead Wrench from Blue Robotics Plug Wrench from Blue Robotics (Optional) Cable Jacket Stripper from Blue Robotics M10-7.5mm-HC WetLink Penetrator from Blue Robotics Silicone grease 5 mm universal drill bit 2 x M5x12 mm stainless steel pan head screws (included with BlueROV2 mounting bracket) 4 x M3x4 mm stainless steel countersunk flat head screws (included with BlueROV2 mounting bracket) Soldering iron Solder wire Wire cutter Tweezers or nose pliers Solder wick and/or desoldering pump Utility knife Wire stripping tool Zip ties 4 x 30 cm (12\") wires (options discussed under Connect DVL-A50 and BlueROV2 ). If possible, use 2 x red and 2 x black wires. 15 cm (6\") ethernet cable Preparation Separate I/O Interface from DVL-A50 The first thing you will have to do before going about any of the installation options is to cut the DVL-A50 cable, separating the I/O Interface board. We recommend you do so near the end where the I/O Interface board is to begin with. Warning The DVL-A50 cable is permanently attached and non-replaceable inside the DVL-A50. If you cut the cable too short you will either have to splice the cable with another cable, or order a new DVL-A50. Measure twice, cut once! Attaching the BlueROV2 mounting bracket Attach the BlueROV2 mounting bracket to the DVL-A50 using the 4 x M3x6 screws provided with the DVL-A50 BlueROV2 Integration Kit. The BlueROV2 mounting bracket can be attached to the BlueROV2 in one of the 2 places indicated in the image below (standard BlueROV2). Note In this configuration the DVL-A50 is pointing backwards meaning both the x-direction and the y-direction are flipped. Multiplying the velocity data in x- and y-direction with -1 will flip coordinates back again to the same perspective frame of the BlueROV2. If your BlueROV2 has the Heavy Configuration upgrade, the BlueROV2 mounting bracket can be attached such that the DVL-A50 is within the BlueROV2 frame. This allows for a minimum working distance of 0 cm for the DVL-A50. Mark 2 hole positions on the BlueROV2 frame for attaching the BlueROV2 mounting bracket and drill through the frame using a 5 mm universal drill bit. Check that the BlueROV2 mounting bracket will attach properly to the BlueROV2 frame using 2 x M5x16 mm screws. No need to secure the bracket in place as more work must be done on the cable end. Final cable lenght With the DVL-A50 now attached to the BlueROV2 frame, find the appropriate cable length needed by leading the cable back to the penetrator end cap of the BlueROV2 and add the length of the electronics enclosure (30 cm) to the cable. This is the minimum required cable length. Tip We recommend adding at least another 30 cm to the cable to provide enough service loop in case the penetrator fails or the leads get damaged. Cut the cable to the final length. Installation The DVL-A50 will be permanently installed on the BlueROV2 with the I/O Interface board (supplied with the DVL-A50). I/O Interface preparation To prepare the I/O Interface Board you will need: Soldering iron Wire cutter Tweezers or nose pliers Solder wick and/or desoldering pump Cut off the zip tie holding the cable onto the I/O Interface board. Cut off the individual wires soldered onto the I/O Interface board. Leave enough wire to grab onto with tweezers or nose pliers. Desolder all the cut wires. Use solder wick and/or a desoldering pump to remove any excess solder from the now desoldered through hole pads. Warning Using too much force or heat may delaminate the I/O Interface PCB, rendering the I/O Interface board useless. Adding a penetrator To add a penetrator to the cable you will need: Plug Wrench from Blue Robotics M10-7.5mm-HC WetLink Penetrator from Blue Robotics (Optional) Cable Jacket Stripper from Blue Robotics Utility knife Strip off 25-30 cm of the cable jacket using a cable jacket stripper, a utility knife or a sharp blade. Take care not to cut into the leads inside the cable. Blue Robotics has a great guide on cable stripping here . Follow the WetLink Penetrator Assembly Guide by BlueRobotics to add a penetrator on the DVL-A50 cable. Removing a blank penetrator To remove a blank penetrator from your BlueROV2, you will need the following tools: 2.5 mm hex driver Bulkhead Wrench from Blue Robotics To ensure your ROV is completely powered off, please remove the battery completely from the 3\u201d enclosure and place to the side. (Optional) Remove the fairings and buoyancy blocks by removing the self-tapping screws that hold the fairings to the frame. Remove the 4\u201d electronics enclosure from the ROV by removing the M3x16 screws that mount the enclosure to the ROV cradle. Remove the Vent Plug from the Vent Penetrator Bolt on the electronics enclosure. Remove the 4\u2033 tube and forward dome assembly from the rear end cap. Remove a blank penetrator, sush as the one pictured below, from the 4\u201d End Cap with the penetrator wrench. Install DVL-A50 penetrator Note The following images shows the old penetrator from BlueRobotics. The procedure is the same with the new WetLink penetrators. To install DVL-A50 into the end cap, you will need the following parts and tools: DVL-A50 with installed cable penetrator Penetrator O-ring (included with M10-7.5mm-HC WetLink Penetrator from Blue Robotics) Bulkhead Wrench from Blue Robotics Silicone Grease Isopropyl Alcohol Wipe Wipe the exterior surface of the electronics enclosure end cap clean with isopropyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol wipes, and make sure it is free of any particles in the areas where the penetrator O-ring will sit. Remove the O-ring from the bag Install the O-ring onto the DVL-A50 cable penetrator and apply silicone grease to it. Push the wires throught the hole in the end cap where you previously removed a blank penetrator from. Tip Since the penetrator has to be screwed on, adding a bit of tape around the end of the wires helps them stay untangles while turning. Also twisting the DVL-A50 cable in a clock-wise direction will aid in screwing on the penetrator. Screw on the DVL-A50 cable penetrator to the end cap. Tighten to finger tight, then use the penetrator wrench to tighten it an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can\u2019t loosen it with your fingers, it is tight enough. Reinstall I/O Interface Board To reinstall the I/O Interface Board onto the DVL-A50 cable you will need: Wire stripping tool Soldering iron Solder wire Zip tie With the DVL-A50 penetrator now through the 4\" End Cap, strip off 2-3 mm of the ends of all the wires. Wire sizes are detailed in the table below. The blue pair can be removed as it is not used for the DVL-A50. Warning The two wires of a twisted wire pair are fully colored and fully white (the table below shows the white wires having a stripe of the complementing color, this is not the reality and only for reference). Keep track of which white wire is paired with which colored wire! Also note that the wiring in the images below differ from that of the table below. Please follow the table! Re-solder the leads of the DVL-A50 cable to the I/O Interface board following the table below: DVL-A50 cable I/O Interface pad Function Diameter (mm) AWG# GND Power ground 0.6 mm 22 VIN Power in 0.6 mm 22 TD+ Ethernet TX+ 0.6 mm 22 TD- Ethernet TX- 0.4 mm 26 RD+ Ethernet RX+ 0.4 mm 26 RD- Ethernet RX- 0.4 mm 26 TX Serial UART TX 0.4 mm 26 RX Serial UART RX 0.4 mm 26 Zip tie the soldered wires to the I/O Interface board to protect the solder joints. Connect to BlueROV2 To connect the DVL-A50 to the BlueROV2 you will need: 2 x 30 cm (12\") wires for power to the DVL-A50 BlueRobotics ethernet switch 6\" ethernet cable Zip ties To provide power to the DVL-A50 you can either use (A) a 2-pin Molex MicroFit3.0 cable assembly , (B) solder on a W\u00fcrth screw terminal , or (C) directly solder on 2 wires to the power pads. Connect VIN to the positive Power Terminal Block inside the BlueROV2 by either stripping off 6-8 mm of the wire and screw it in place, or add a spade terminal for a # 6 screw (M3.5) and screw in place. Connect GND to the negative Power Terminal Block by either stripping off 6-8 mm of the wire and screw it in place, or add a spade terminal for a # 6 screw (M3.5) and screw in place. Warning The Power Terminal Blocks are unregulated and directly connected to the battery. Any short may generate several amps which will fry most circuits. Check that the wires are secured properly in both ends. Install the BlueRobotics ethernet switch following the Ethernet Switch Installation Guide for the BlueROV2 by BlueRobotics. With power and ethernet switch now sorted, connect a 6\" ethernet cable from the ethernet switch to the IO Interface board. Tip Some thick double-sided sticky tape and zip ties can be used to secure the I/O Interface to the electronics frame inside the BlueROV2. Reassemble BlueROV2 electronics enclosure To reassemble your BlueROV2 Electronics Enclosure, you will need the following parts and tools: 4 x M3x16 screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly Silicone Grease 2.5 mm hex driver Reinstall 4\u201d Watertight Enclosure onto ROV with the following steps: Apply silicone grease to the two radial O-rings on the O-Ring Flange (4\u201d Series) that is attached to the Electronics Tray. Install the Watertight Enclosure (4\u201d Series) with installed Dome End Cap to the O-Ring Flange (4\u201d Series). Warning Use caution when sliding the 4\" Watertight Enclosure over the electronics as space may be tight (collides with electronics) and wires can get trapped between the 4\" tube and the 4\" end cap. Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). This allows clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series) easily. Attach DVL-A50 to BlueROV2 Note The following images show the old version of the DVL-A50 with steel housing. The new housing has the same dimensions as the old. Attach the DVL-A50 to the BlueROV2 using the 2 x M5x16 screws provided with the DVL-A50 BlueROV2 Integration Kit through the two holes you've made previously. Excess cable can be bundled together and attached to the BlueROV2 frame using zip ties. Software The DVL-A50 requires an extension in BlueOS to be able to communicate with the autopilot (Pixhawk or Navigator flight controller). BlueOS has to be updated to BlueOS 1.1.0 or newer to assure that extensions are supported sufficiently. After the update install the latest BlueOS-Water-Linked-DVL extension from the BlueOS extension manager. It is best to disable the BlueOS \"Water Linked UGPS\"-extension if you have that installed. Note If you want to use both DVL and UGPS you can find a detailed guide here Open the interface of the DVL-extension and click the button \"Load parameters for DVL\". Those parameters are persistent over reboots, which means that this button only needs to be pressed once and not every time you restart the ROV. Restart the autopilot for the parameter changes to take effect. It is not necessary to restart BlueOS. Set the global vehicle position in the DVL extension every time you start the ROV. Note There is a known bug where the I2C address of the pressure sensor is set wrong, and so depth is not received properly. This can be fixed by setting the parameter BARO_PROBE_EXT to 768 and then reboot the ROV.","title":"DVL for BlueROV2"},{"location":"dvl/bluerov-integration/#introduction","text":"The Water Linked DVLs are designed to integrate with most ROVs and AUVs through ethernet and/or a serial interface (UART).

This uses both the velocities which the DVL calculates and its integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). Starting dead reckoning Calibrate the gyroscope by pressing More -> Calibrate gyro in the GUI whilst the DVL is stationary. Click the 'Reset' button in the GUI , or send a reset command over the TCP or serial protocol . Failure to perform gyro calibration will result in less accurate dead reckoning. Frame The position, speed, and roll, pitch, and yaw angles outputted by the dead reckoning algorithm are with respect to the frame defined at time zero (the time of the last reset, or else at start up) by the axes of the vehicle frame . Speed and position The speed and position of the DVL are calculated by integration of its acceleration, corrected by the velocity it calculates by means of its acoustic signal processing. A Kalman filter is used; the roll, pitch, and yaw angles outputted by the DVL are also part of the input. When the DVL fails in its determination of velocity, speed and position are predicted only by acceleration. This will result in large errors, indicated by an increase in the figure of merit (FOM), which is an estimated standard deviation of the position in the X-Y plane. Note When the DVL is powered on in the air, its position will drift significantly. This should be ignored, and dead reckoning should be started in water when ready. The position of the DVL can be viewed in the GUI dashboard or be fetched by API . Orientation The calculation of the orientation of the DVL is based upon the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements of its IMU. The orientation is represented by roll, pitch, and yaw angles, and can be viewed in the GUI dashboard or be fetched by API . Roll is a rotation around the X axis of the DVL Pitch is a rotation around the Y axis of the DVL Yaw is a rotation around the Z axis of the DVL For orientation to function correctly, the DVL must be deployed in accordance with its axis conventions . Note A small tilt in the DVL mounting, though it will result in almost no position error with respect to the X and Y axes, may lead a significant error with respect to the Z axis. This change will be a projection of the true horizontal position onto the Z axis. For example, when the DVL is mounted with 5\u00b0 tilt and the horizontal displacement of the DVL is 100m since last reset, the total displayed distance in the X, Y plane will be 99.6 m, and the Z position will be \u00b19 m.

ACK - Acknowledgement. The command issued was successful. NAK - Negative acknowledgement. The command issued failed. Ping - A pulse of sound sent by the DVL Time of validity - Timestamp of the surface reflection ('center of ping') Time of transmission - Timestamp taken directly before sending data over the serial or TCP protocols.

Release 2.6.1 and later allow different baud rates through GUI configuration. Packets sent to and received from the DVL start with a w and end with LF, CR+LF, or CR. The packet format is: Start byte Direction Command Options (0 to many) Checksum End byte w c or r x ,[option] *xx \\n , \\r\\n , or \\r Direction is c (short for 'command') for packets sent to the DVL, and r (short for 'response') for packets sent from the DVL. The commands can be sent from a terminal program that supports sending a full line at a time. The timeout between characters is approximately 10 ms. Note Please verify the baud rate configuration in the GUI if you are unable to communicate with the default baud rate. Note The checksum is optional when sending commands to the DVL. The DVL always returns a checksum. The checksum algorithm is CRC-8 and it is formatted as a hexadecimal number using 2 lower-case characters (ex: *c3 ). See below for details. Command overview The commands in the table are shown without the checksum and without the mandatory line ending (any of \\n , \\r\\n , or \\r ) for readability. In all cases, the response to a submitted command may be wrn , wr? , or wr! (see below for details), but only the format of a successful response is listed.

Float acoustic_enabled y for normal operation of the DVL, n when the sending of acoustic waves from the DVL is disabled (e.g. to save power or slow down its heating up in air) dark_mode_enabled n when the LED operates as normal . y for no blinking of LED (e.g. if the LED is interfering with a camera) range_mode auto when operating as normal, otherwise see range mode configuration periodic_cycling_enabled y when operating as normal, otherwise n . See Configuration over JSON for details Note For backward compatibility the range_mode and periodic_cycling_enabled parameters are optional when setting the configuration. They will always be returned when reading the configuration ( wcc ). Speed of sound and mounting rotation was changed from integer to float in serial protocol 2.4.0 Fetching current configuration The current configuration of the DVL can be obtained by issuing the wcc command. If the configuration is successfully fetched, the response will be in the following format. If not, a nak wrn will be returned. wrc,[speed_of_sound],[mounting_rotation_offset],[acoustic_enabled],[dark_mode_enabled],[range_mode],[periodic_cycling_enabled] Setting configuration parameters Setting of configuration parameters can be carried out by issuing the wcs command in the following format. wcs,[speed_of_sound],[mounting_rotation_offset],[acoustic_enabled],[dark_mode_enabled],[range_mode],[periodic_cycling_enabled] Those parameters which are not to be set can be left blank. Example for setting dark mode without changing the other parameters: wcs,,,,y,, Example for setting speed of sound to 1450 m/s and disabling acoustics, without changing the other parameters: wcs,1450,,n,,, The response will be an ack wra if the parameters are successfully set, a nak wrn if the command was successfully parsed but the parameters were not successfully set, and a malformed request wr? if the command was not successfully parsed, e.g. if the wrong number of parameters was used, or either speed_of_sound or mounting_rotation_offset was not an integer. The new configuration will not be returned in the response, but can be obtained by issuing a wcc command as above.

Check if DVL is powered Put the DVL under water and power it on with an adequate power supply. Does the DVL pull any current? Expected current consumption: Approximate average 260mA at 18V Does the LED turn on? LED For LED status, see LED Signals . Wiring Check that you have wired your DVL correctly, see Wiring interface . 1.1 If you have a custom connector you need to ask the supplier for the correct drawings. Check for damages along the cable and that there are good connection where you have terminated your DVL. Check for short between Negative/Ground and Positive (10-30V). Environmental Check The Line of sight should be clear of any obstacles including walls, see Line of sight . 1.1 One easy way to make sure the Line of sight is clear from any walls is to observe that all beam shows approximately the same distance to the bottom. If some of the beams are flickering or showing another distance it might pick up a reflection from a wall or some other obstacle in the line of sight. Obstacle free radius from the DVL to the wall depending on the distance to the bottom can be calculated with this formula: Obstacle free radius = tan(32.5\u00b0) \u00d7 distance from DVL to bottom . If testing in a pool, tank or bucket it should not be made out of a polished metal or very clean surfaces. This can introduce more noise and make it harder for the DVL to get a bottom lock. Check that there are no motors, echo sunders, pumps, running house. This can create noise in the same frequency as the DVL and have an impact on the acoustic signal. Make sure the environment is not acting on the DVL in a way that makes it pitch and yaw (waves). That will send the acoustic signal in many directions making it hard to achieve a bottom lock. Thermal shutdown - Does the DVL look like it is constantly powering on and off The DVL has a thermal shutdown mechanism to avoid damage. It will issue a warning before shutting down at 55\u2103. Once it cools below 50\u2103, it automatically restarts. If the overheating issue is not addressed, it may repeat this shutdown/restart cycle. Is the DVL in water?

Click on a question in the table of contents to the right or simply scroll down to read the FAQs. 1. Do I need to calibrate the IMU each time I power on the DVL? No. If you use the software version 2.4.5 or later, the calibration is saved in memory. 2. Will the temperature affect the IMU? Yes. The IMU will perform differently under temperatures that differ significantly from the conditions at which it was calibrated. 3. Why does the yaw angle change rapidly? Yaw angle in the DVL GUI may increase or otherwise change rapidly if the DVL\u2019s gyro has not been calibrated or temperature changes. Please see the following for more on calibration: Calibrate the IMU Note If only the velocity output of the DVL is required, you can ignore changes in yaw angle. The yaw angle is only relevant (and thus calibration is needed) if the DVL\u2019s dead reckoning functionality is used. 4. Can we test/operate the DVL in air? You will not be able to get valid velocity measurements in air. It is possible to power the DVL out of the water for a short time, but the DVL warms up quickly. If possible, we recommend avoiding this. A great setup for lab work is to keep the DVL submerged in a small bucket of water. We realize it may be impractical to avoid air usage altogether when the DVL is mounted. One option is to disable the DVL\u2019s acoustics while it is out of water to reduce heating. This option is available under Configuration in the DVL GUI. Note If you do use the DVL in air, we strongly recommend running software version 2.0.8 or higher, which allows the DVL to shut down safely if it reaches a critical temperature. 5. What is the connector on the DVL? The DVL A50/A125 is supplied with a cable tail that includes an interface board containing: An Ethernet connector, allowing a direct plug-and-play link to your computer. A Micro-USB port (Revision 4 I/O card), enabling USB output. Simply plug a USB cable from the DVL to your computer. Earlier revisions have a UART interface on the board, which can be soldered to for serial connections. The interface board can be removed for permanent mounting on a vehicle. Refer to the wiring interface documentation for setting up Ethernet and/or serial connections as needed. Water Linked does not provide a specific connector for this purpose. 6. Can the DVL be used as an ADCP? No. The DVL\u2019s algorithms are specifically designed to track reflections from the seafloor. An ADCP requires measuring reflections from water-borne particles at various depths, which uses a different processing approach. 7. Why does the DVL lose connection? If you notice periodic data dropouts or lost connections, there are a few common causes to consider: Insufficient Power If the DVL is not receiving enough power, you may see periodic dropouts. Try using a power supply with higher voltage/current (for instance, 18V at up to 2A or 24V at up to 1.5A). Poor Physical Connection If the DVL was previously functioning but suddenly loses connection, inspect cables, connectors, and any terminations on the ROV or topside computer. Thermal Shutdown To protect the DVL from damage due to overheating, it may shut down automatically. This will result in a lost connection until it cools and restarts. 8. What is the Source level (dB re 1 \u03bcPa @ 1 m)? The maximum transmit source level is 200 dB. 9. Can the DVL overheat? Yes. The DVL has a thermal shutdown to avoid damage. It will issue a warning before shutting down at 55\u2103. Once it cools below 50\u2103, it automatically restarts. If the overheating issue is not addressed, it may repeat this shutdown/restart cycle. To avoid this always keep the DVL in water when powered on. 10. What is the latency when using the API over Ethernet? When sending commands over TCP, the average latency is around 4 ms, with a standard deviation of 2 ms. The maximum observed latency is 13 ms. 11. Does the DVL have an RS-232 interface? No. The DVL does not support RS-232. It only provides a TTL (3.3V) UART interface, which is inherently incompatible with RS-232. If RS-232 is required, you will need an external level converter. 12. What is the velocity output frequency? The velocity output frequency varies with altitude. - At lower altitudes (close to the seafloor), the DVL can reach an update frequency of 15 Hz . - At higher altitudes, it typically operates between 2\u20134 Hz . For more details, see Range mode . In Auto mode , the DVL automatically selects the range mode it deems optimal. 13. Will the DVL work over a soft seabed, such as sand? Yes, the DVL can operate over soft bottoms. However, softer seabeds absorb more acoustic energy, which reduces the maximum altitude at which the DVL can reliably track. The degree of range reduction varies from environment to environment and may require on-site testing to determine. 14. I get an error when updating my DVL? Most likely your DVL is running an older software version that requires you to set the time before you can update. This is not and issue when updating from version 2.6.5 For more software update details please see DVL Software Updates.","title":"DVL FAQ"},{"location":"dvl/faq/#dvl-faq","text":"Below are some frequently asked questions about the DVL.

Please note that the DVL electronics themselves are not internally connected to the shield; it is up to the user to decide whether and how to connect the shield. Note For DVLA50, shielded cables were introduced autumn 2024 from serial number 30273 and upwards, and 05838 and upwards. DVLA50's with Seacon MCOMSM connector and DVLA50's made before autumn 2024 are delivered with unshielded cable. All DVLA125 are delivered with shielded cable. Connecting the Shield For optimal performance, especially when mounted on an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) or AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), it is recommended to connect the shield to reduce the impact of interference on the communication and power signals. The most common connection methods are: Chassis Ground : Connecting the shield to the chassis of the ROV/AUV is the most typical practice. This method allows the shield to provide a path to ground for any noise or interference, helping to improve signal integrity. The ROV or AUV chassis often acts as a common reference point for grounding, which makes this a natural choice. Common Ground : Alternatively, you can connect the shield to the common electrical ground of the ROV/AUV. This method may be used when the electrical and signal systems are designed to share a common ground. It helps ensure that interference is grounded without creating ground loops. Recommendation We recommend connecting the shield to the chassis ground of the ROV or AUV (if possible). This approach generally provides the best noise suppression by using the vehicle\u2019s structure as a solid grounding point. However, if your system design prefers the use of a common electrical ground, that option can also be considered. Always ensure that the shield is grounded at one end only to avoid ground loops, unless your system design calls for grounding at both ends for specific applications. Terminal Interface The DVL-A50 has a 3.3 volt UART interface (5V tolerant). Settings Value Baud rate 115200 Data parity stop 8N1 Flow control None Warning There can be a momentary (<10 us) power spike (~5 V) on the UART lines when power is applied to the DVL, which may damage equipment which is not 5V tolerant. See the DVL's serial protocol . Ethernet Interface See networking and the DVL's TCP protocol . Code examples Code for parsing of the data outputted by the DVL over TCP. I/O interface The I/O Interface provides a simple means of connection to the Water Linked DVLs. It provides magnetics for the ethernet connection and utilizes the Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 power connector (Part number: 436500204) which is standard for Water Linked products. Female connectors is listed under Mates with Part(s) There currently exists three revisions of the I/O Interface. Revision 2 and 3 are electrically identical.

Underwater GPS Explorer Kit The Underwater GPS Explorer Kit is a robust and reliable acoustic positioning system with a range of 100m. The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, divers and other moving objects below the water surface. The Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. The Locator is placed on the device to be positioned and functions as a beacon that send out an acoustic pulse. Near the surface, there are four Receiver hydrophones lowered into the water. The Receivers listen for the pulse from the locator. Time-of-arrival to each Receiver is used to calculate the Locator\u2019s position. SBL systems, compared to the USBL systems, have the advantage of working well in shallow water and acoustic reflective environments, such as in fish cages, near harbor installations, close to ship hulls, inside water tanks etc. Once the position is known relative to the Receivers, the global position can be found by adding that to the position obtained by a GPS receiver. The Underwater GPS system does that part internally so that it can provide the actual global position of the ROV as its output.

The steps are: Power the topside unit Calibrate IMU Deploying receivers Connect everything Select locator and channel Configure receiver placement in GUI Power the topside unit Start by connecting power to the topside unit. We do this first because we want the GPS receiver to start receiving signals and acheive a lock while we setup the rest of the system. If you are using the Locator-S1, power it on now so it also have time to get GPS lock. Calibrate IMU Connect the Ethernet cable to the topside unit and your computer. Then open your web browser and type in the IP-address of your topside unit which is defined by the position of the dip-switch on the Master-D1. How to change the IP-address is described here . At the top bar on the GUI you will see a calibration bar for the IMU. To calibrate the IMU rotate it in a figure of 8 and keep doing it until the IMU calibration bar becomes full and green. Deploying of receivers Before starting to deploy the receivers in the water, add a piece of tape on the receiver cable on the desired depth to make setup easier. Place the receivers in the water on the desired location and decide which number (1-4) each receiver will have. This is important when connecting the receivers to the topside unit. Tip Adding lead weights just above the receiver helps keep them stable when doing the positioning. Connect everything When connecting the receiver cables to the topside unit remember the numbering you decided on and connect the connector to the accordingly port. If this is not correct the position will be completely wrong. Next you connect the Locator if you are using the A1 or D1. Select locator and channel Now that everything is connected and ready it is time to select the right locator and choose which channal to listen on. This is configurated on the setting page of the web GUI. The Water Linked standard is to use channel 17 and this is also the default channel for the Locator-S1. Configure receiver placement and seach range in GUI After selecting the correct locator, you need to provide the correct placement of the receivers to the GUI for the positioning to work correctly. This is done by drag'n drop of each receiver to the correct placment relative to the topside unit. The position of each receiver is seen below in the map view. It you click on the receiver you get a pop up with the possibility to write its exact placment. Once this is done you can limit the search range by using the same drag and drop feature. Warning If you are using the Locator-A1 or S1, you need to provide depth information to the topside unit. This is achieved using the explorer-kit API . Tip Reducing the search range helps to improve the performance of the system. It is recomended to limith this range if you are operating in a smaller area. This is especially important in tanks.

In order to ensure the best performance, you should follow a few guidelines: Line-of-sight Try to place the Receivers so they all have a free line-of-sight to the Locator. Good Separation The system performs better when there is a decent distance between the Receivers. More separation is better, but 2x2 meters is sufficient for good performance. Max Range There should be maximum of 100m from any Receiver to the Locator Receiver Depth Place the Receivers at a few meters depth. Near the surface there are typically small air bubbles caused by waves. These small air bubbles attenuate the acoustic signal and can reduce the system performance. Limit search area You will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the search area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is expected to be. Directivity The Receivers and Locators are fully omnidirectional and transmits/receives equally good in all directions. The only direction with less performance is backwards where the cable enters. Receiver stability Add some weight to the Receiver cable just above the Receiver so they hang straight down in the water On board GPS If the master electronics is static during operation it is recommended to use the static option for the GPS. This is to remove the inaccuracy of the GPS Receiver in global position. Only use onboard GPS when the reference system is moving eg. if mounted to a boat. Reference Systems In order to calculate the absolute position of the Locator we need to define two reference systems, the acoustic and the global reference system. The global reference system is defined by latitude and longitude and is the reference system used by the GPS and in maps. The acoustic reference system (the x and y axis) is defined by the orientation of the housing. The housing is by definition located in origin (x=0, y=0). A label on top of the lid indicates the x-y coordinate system. Boat Example The illustration bellow shows a typical Receiver configuration when installed on a boat. The Receivers are hanging from the side of the boat, one in each corner. The depth of the Receivers are typically 2-4m, deep enough to get below the hull and get free line-of-sight to the Locator.

Description The Locator-U1 is a battery powered, digital hydro acoustic locator device. It carries an internal GPS based time sync module, which means no tether is required. This Locator fits well for divers, ROVs where power is not easily accessible, or other underwater applications. The internal battery is rechargeable using the USB-C cable that follows and standard 5V USB charger. Before deployment in water, the Locator-U1 needs to achieve a GPS lock. The integrated status-LED shows the condition of the GPS lock. Once the Locator-U1 has lock it can operate for approximately 6 hours befor needing resync with GPS. The Locator-U1 has a rotary switch located on the inside of the cap. This switch is used to change the channel on which the Locator is transmitting. The same channel needs to be selected in the Water Linked Underwater GPS GUI. The Locator has 3 mounting holes on each side for M3 screws. A default bracket is included. Charging Insert included USB-C cable into a wall adapter (2A/5V) and connect it to the Locator-U1. The Locator LED will normally start pulsating while charging and turn solid green once charging has finished. Note : If battery is fully discharged the pulsating will not be activated. The Locator will still charge regardless of the LED not showing the charge indication. The Locator will in this cause show searching for GPS lock or GPS lock achieved indication. Note : Some Locator-U1 units are produced with a fault that causes them to never be able to show the charge indication. The Locator will still charge and operate as normal during use. Charging time is 7 hours. Powering on/off To power on the Locator-U1 simply tighten the lid over the charging port. The the LED will start to blinking indicating that the Locator is searching for GPS lock. The Locator is ready to use when the LED stops blinking and turns solid. Before powering on, ensure the O-ring within the lid is without damage. To power off the Locator-U1 unscrew the back lid until the LED turns off.

Click on a question in the table of contents to the right or simply scroll down to read the FAQs. 1. Can the M16 modem measure the range/distance between two modems? No, the modem's uses an unsynchronized method of sending data meaning that an time of flight estimate would give large errors in the range estimations. The acoustic signal is not synced but known to be within some time frame of 25ms. However if looking at the Signal to noise ratio (SNR) you can use it to indicate that the distance between the modems is fare or close. For example would a grater SNR (better signal) indicate that it is most likely close as it has so good signal. 2. Do the modem retransmit data packets? Yes, If the modem is set to parrot mode (see Parrot Mode ), it will retransmit all packets it has received. 3. Does the modem need line of sight to communicate between them? Yes, they do. 4. Can the modem be mounted below a shell on an ROV? No, the transducer part of the modem must be in the water to be able to send and receive signals. 5. How should the modem be mounted to achiecve the best possible signal strength The signal strength from the Modem-M16 is donut-shaped around the transducer. Below is a simple scetch that illustrates the signal strength in all directions. For shorter distances the mounting is not relevant, as the signal is transmitted in all directions and also reflected at the surface, seabed or other constructions in the water. On long distances or to achieve optimal behaviour, the mounting position might slightly impact the signal range of the modem.","title":"M16 FAQ"},{"location":"modem-m16/modem-m16-faq/#modem-m16-faq","text":"Below are some frequently asked questions about the Modem M16.

The modem can be controlled using a 3.3V UART or RS422 connection. It is offering two primary operational modes (transparent mode and diagnostic mode), four different power levels, user-selectable communication channels, and a possibility to set the modem in parrot mode for testing. For details of the protocol used to implement the settings, see Modem-M16-Protocol Interface overview The standard Modem-M16 has a 3.3V TTL UART interface and the extended version has a RS422 interface. Both with the following configuration: Settings Value Baud rate 9600 Data parity stop 8N1 Flow control None Through this serial link, you can: Set operational modes Change communication channels Request diagnostic reports Adjust power levels for transmission range/power consumption Set modem in parrot mode for testing Settings Interface You can configure the modem by issuing commands over the serial link. Five user-configurable parameters are available: Communication Channel Operation Mode Power Level Report Request Parrot mode Each configuration command requires sending specific characters with a 1-second pause between them, followed by a character that selects the new value. For details on how to send the commands, see the configuration protocol: Modem-M16-Protocol Communication Channel The modem can operate on 12 channels (1 to 12). This allows for several modems to be used at the same time. Two modems must share the same channel to communicate. There are two ways to implement communication between several modems. You can have several sending modems that transmit on different channels, and one receiving modem that switch between the channels to listen for messages, or you can have several sending and receiving modems, where every two modems are sending and listening to each other on the same channel. Operational Modes The modem supports two main operational modes: Transparent Serial Mode Processes and transmits only 2 bytes of data per packet. Each transmission takes ~1.6 seconds (acoustic wave duration). Data beyond the first 2 bytes in a transmission is discarded. Diagnostic Mode Sends detailed status reports, the same report that can be retrieved with the \"request report\" command, including: Transport Block (TB) Bit Error Rate (BER) Signal & Noise Power LDPC/CRC Validity Firmware Revision Time Since Power-Up FPGA Chip ID, Hardware Revision Communication Channel TX-Complete Status Power Level Setting Still limited to 2 bytes of payload per transmission (discarding any additional data). Reports are triggered automatically when: A new packet is received (TB Valid bit is set) A transmission completes (TX Complete bit is set) 4 seconds have elapsed since the last report Note You can also request a diagnostic report while in transparent mode. See the Request Report Command section. Power Levels The modem has four power levels where 1 is the weakest and 4 is the strongest level. If you need to save power and do not require the signal to travel a long distance, you might want to choose a lower power level. By default the modem is set to maximal power and range. Up to 1000m. Power Level Avg. TX Power (mW) Typical Max Range (m) 1 390 300 2 555 600 3 790 900 4 (Default) 1105 1000 Note Maximum range is highly dependent on environmental factors, including noise levels and line-of-sight conditions between modems. Request Report The diagnostic report provided by this command is the same as the report retrieved every fourth second in diagnostic mode. In both diagnostic and transparent modes, you can request a report at any time. When a command is sent the modem will immediately generate a diagnostic report. For details of the structure of the diagnostic report and how it can be decoded see Diagnostic report Parrot mode A modem can be set to parrot mode, which might be useful for tests. When a modem is in parrot mode it always immediately returns the acoustic message it receives. This can typically be used in range tests with one modem set to parrot mode and one modem sending an acoustic message and wait for it to be returned. Note Do not forget to reset parrot mode after use. Ensuring Successful Transmission & Optimization Diagnostic Mode A report is sent immediately after each transmission. Monitor the TX_COMPLETE bit in the report to know when the modem is ready for the next 2-byte packet. This approach maximizes overall throughput. Transparent Serial Mode Send 2 bytes, then wait at least 1.6 seconds (the transmission duration) before sending the next 2 bytes to avoid data loss. Flash Memory Considerations Changing the modem mode , channel , or power level initiates a flash write operation , which takes about 1 second . During this time: The modem will not respond to commands. Do not power off the modem to avoid corrupting settings. Once the flash write completes, the modem resumes normal operation with the updated configuration.

This protocol efficiently transmits data such as 3D points or grayscale bitmaps over UDP multicast, enabling live visualization, analysis, or archival for later use. Range Image Protocol (RIP1) RIP1 is a compact format for range and bitmap images, designed for <10\u202fMbit bandwidth. Each packet: Fits within a single UDP packet (max 65,507\u202fbytes). Starts with the 4-byte ID \"RIP1\" . Contains a length field, a serialized Protobuf payload, and a CRC-32. Decoding Steps : Verify the RIP1 ID. Check the packet length and CRC-32. Decode into waterlinked.rip1.Packet . Use .type_url to identify the contained message. Decode .value into that message type. Interpret fields per the .proto File . Network By default, the Sonar 3D-15 uses UDP Multicast ( 224.0.0.96:4747 ), so any device on the local network can receive data without knowing the sonar\u2019s IP.

Documentation and information about the BlueROV2 can be found at: BlueRobotics Help Center BlueRobotics Contact Us BlueRobotics Technical Reference What's in the box The Sonar 3D-15 from Water Linked is normally shipped with an attached I/O Interface board. What You\u2019ll Need To follow this guide, you will need the following: BlueROV2 Roof Rack A mount (Sonar 3D-15 to ROV) An example can be downloaded from here: 3D step file Correct screws See the Mounting section 2 spade connectors (or ring terminals) A JST 4-pin connector WetLink Penetrator 6.5 (low-compression) WetLink from Blue Robotics Ethernet Switch board Make sure you have an Ethernet Switch installed on your BlueROV2. This is needed for the integration of the Sonar 3D-15. The installation guide for the Ethernet Switch can be found here: Ethernet Switch Installation Guide from Blue Robotics Connector Setup Testing the Sonar 3D-15 Separately If the I/O Interface board is attached, the Sonar 3D-15 can be tested directly using an Ethernet cable and a power supply. If you wish to test the device on its own before integration, follow the general Quickstart tutorial, available here: Quickstart . Connecting to the BlueROV2 To connect the Sonar 3D-15 to the BlueROV2, you have to attach connectors to each of the wires from the Sonar 3D-15. You have to make the final cable assembly resemble the images below - with the cable towards the Sonar 3D-15 on the left and their JST connectors for the BlueROV2 on the right . The installation procedure for the Sonar 3D-15 is very similar to the Water Linked DVL installation, which BlueRobotics has an excellent guide for. We recommend reviewing this guide before proceeding. It can be found here: DVL Installation Guide for BlueROV2 For the remainder of this Sonar 3D-15 guide, we assume you are familiar with the BlueROV2 and its installation procedures. To install the Sonar 3D-15 for the BlueROV2, perform the following procedure: Remove the I/O board . Measure out the required length outside the ROV. Then cut the Sonar cable to that length plus approximately 30cm for inside the ROV. After this step, the I/O board is no longer needed for normal operation. The cables from the Sonar 3D-15 are shown in the picture below. Warning The Sonar 3D-15 cable is permanently attached and non-replaceable inside the Sonar 3D-15 If you cut the cable too short you will either have to splice the cable with another cable, or order a new Sonar 3D-15. Measure twice, cut once! Assemble a waterproof WetLink 6.5 LC Penetrator according to the BlueRobotics guide. It can be found here: WetLink Installation Guide from Blue Robotics Identify the different cables from the Sonar 3D-15. Make sure to correctly identify the different white signal cables. Differentiate between white/green (RX+) and white/orange (TX+) . Sonar Cable Type Sonar Cable Color DC- Black DC+ Red RX+ Green/White RX- Green TX+ Orange/White TX- Orange Solder the spade connectors onto the black and red power cables. Terminate a JST 4-pin connector to the four remaining cables. The order is: Pin Order Wire Color Sonar Cable Type 1 Green/White RX+ 2 Orange/White TX+ 3 Green RX- 4 Orange TX- Make the cables from the Sonar 3D-15 look similar to the following: Install the WetLink Penetrator into the end cap of the watertight enclosure. See the Installing The Penetrator chapter on Blue Robotics' DVL installation guide for proper penetrator installation: DVL Installation Guide for BlueROV2 . Connect the JST connector to the Ethernet Switch board on the BlueROV2. Use port 2, 3, or 4 for the JST connector, as port 5 and 1 are occupied. Connect the power spade connectors of the Sonar 3D-15 cables to the power terminal blocks on the BlueROV2. Connect the black power wire to an available space on the terminal block with the other black wires. Connect the red power wire to and available space on the terminal block with the other red wires. Seal and waterproof the connection and BlueROV2 by closing end cap of the watertight enclosure properly. Mounting The Sonar 3D-15 needs to be physically attached to the BlueROV2 ROV. A possible option on how to do this will be listed here. There are many different approaches to achieve this, and this approach is only listed to provide an idea. Create or find a suitable mount An example 3D step file of a mount is found here: Download 3D step file Note Choose a 3D print material that can withstand the expected operating conditions. Identify the screws and mount to use Use [M4x (5.0 + X) mm] screws to attach the Sonar 3D-15 to the mount, and use [M4x (9.0 + X) mm] screws with hex nuts and washers to attach the mount to the BlueROV2 Roof Rack. Exchange the X with the thickness of your mount. For example, for a 3.0mm thick mount (as the given 3D print) , the following is sufficient: 4x M4x8.0mm screws 4x M4x12.0mm screws 4x M4 Hex Nuts 4x M4 Washers Warning To avoid damaging the Sonar 3D-15, make sure the screws are not too long. Attach the mount to the Sonar 3D-15 Attach the mounted Sonar 3D-15 to the BlueROV2 ROV We recommend putting the Sonar 3D-15 on the BlueROV2 Roof Rack in the front for the BlueROV2. In that way, the Sonar 3D-15 will not block the Sonar 3D-15\u2019s field of view. Note Make sure the Sonar 3D-15 and cable are neatly and securely attached before use. Connection steps 1. Make your ROV ready for launch Follow the BlueROV2 Software Setup guide to make your ROV ready for launch. This shows how to turn on the ROV and what software to install. The Sonar 3D-15 will now show a green light, indicating it is powered. 2. Access the Sonar 3D-15 GUI The Sonar 3D-15 GUI can be accessed by entering the Sonar 3D-15's IP-address into the browser running on the computer connected to the ROV. You have to determine which IP-address has been automatically assigned to the Sonar 3D-15 by the BlueRov2 system. Steps to find it follows below. Once located, entering it in your browser will display a page like the one below \u2014 in this example, the Sonar 3D-15 is assigned the IP-address 192.168.2.172 . Warning Don't operate the Sonar 3D-15 out of water for any long periods. To avoid overheating of the Sonar 3D-15, don\u2019t click the green button \u201cEnable Acoustics\u201d , until the ROV is submerged in water. Acoustics is always disabled when first booting up the Sonar 3D-15, and will be turned on once clicking this button. The Sonar 3D-15 will automatically turn itself off if too hot, but will take some time to cool down, it's best to avoid this happening. Find the IP-address corresponding to the Sonar 3D-15 on a computer by doing the following: Find the IP-address of your computer on the BlueROV2 network You need your own network IP-address on the BlueROV2 network. On Linux you find it by typing in: ip a in the terminal. On Windows you find it by typing in: ipconfig Tip It's easier to find your IP-address if your computer is connected only to the BlueROV2 network. Test and find the Sonar 3D-15's IP-address A quick easy way to see the IP-addresses of the devices on your local network is to use nmap . Install it for your operating system and go to the terminal and write nmap -sn <YOUR_IP> This will scan the BlueROV2 network and show all accessible connected devices and their IPs. To find the IP-address of the Sonar 3D-15, try the IP-addresses on the list by typing them into the search bar of your browser. For example, if you have the list above, try 192.168.2.2 , 192.168.2.136 , 192.168.2.172 and so on. You may try them all safely. If the Sonar 3D-15 GUI appears, you have found the correct IP-address. Tip You can also access the GUI on the Sonar 3D-15's fallback address 192.168.194.96 . This method is explained in more detail on the general quickstart guide, which can be found at Quickstart . 3. (Optional) Open Cockpit with the Sonar 3D-15 GUI We recommend using Cockpit , a new, highly customizable ground control station software from Blue Robotics. More information about Cockpit can be found here: Cockpit Information , and it can be installed from here: Install Cockpit . Once Cockpit is installed and the BlueROV2 is ready for launch, you will see the Cockpit GUI, as shown in the following picture. Click the collapse handle on the left to reveal the GUI options. Click Edit Interface . Here you can change the layout of the GUI. We will add a frame to display the Sonar 3D-15 GUI. Click and drag an IFrame box onto the main screen. An IFrame box will appear with the standard BlueOS page. Resize it as needed to fit your desired layout. Click the settings icon for the IFrame . The following configuration panel will appear. Instead of http://blueos-avahi.local , enter the IP-address for the Sonar 3D-15, as found in the previous step. In this example, the IP-address is http://192.168.2.172 . Press Enter on your keyboard, then close the settings panel. The Sonar 3D-15 GUI will now appear in the IFrame box within your Cockpit control station. Warning To avoid overheating of the Sonar 3D-15, don\u2019t click the green \"Enable Acoustics\" button , until the ROV is submerged in water. 4. Put the ROV into water You are now ready to put the ROV into water. 4. Enable acoustics When ready, click the \u201dEnable acoustics\u201d button to initiate the Sonar 3D-15.

The installation procedure for the Sonar 3D-15 is very similar to the Water Linked DVL installation, which BlueRobotics has an excellent guide for. We recommend reviewing this guide before proceeding. It can be found here: DVL Installation Guide for BlueROV2 For the remainder of this Sonar 3D-15 guide, we assume you are familiar with the BlueROV2 and its installation procedures. To install the Sonar 3D-15 for the BlueROV2, perform the following procedure: Remove the I/O board . Measure out the required length outside the ROV. Then cut the Sonar cable to that length plus approximately 30cm for inside the ROV. After this step, the I/O board is no longer needed for normal operation. The cables from the Sonar 3D-15 are shown in the picture below. Warning The Sonar 3D-15 cable is permanently attached and non-replaceable inside the Sonar 3D-15 If you cut the cable too short you will either have to splice the cable with another cable, or order a new Sonar 3D-15. Measure twice, cut once! Assemble a waterproof WetLink 6.5 LC Penetrator according to the BlueRobotics guide. It can be found here: WetLink Installation Guide from Blue Robotics Identify the different cables from the Sonar 3D-15. Make sure to correctly identify the different white signal cables.

Note We recomend operating the Sonar 3D-15 GUI on a seperate device so that you can view the sonar while continuing to operate the ROV as usual on the main ROV controller display; typically your smartphone. Both the device and Chasing need to have DHCP enabled. This is standard for most computers and phones and is normally enabled. To check if your computer has DHCP enabled, do the following: Checking DHCP --> Windows - Option 1: Open Settings > Network & Internet . Click on Ethernet Select your active connection. Scroll to IP settings: If it says Automatic (DHCP) \u2192 it's enabled. If it says Manual \u2192 DHCP is off. --> Windows - Option 2: Run the following command in the Windows terminal ipconfig /all Look for the section Ethernet adapter Ethernet and the line DHCP Enabled (green arrow) If DHCP Enabled is set to Yes , then DHCP is enabled. --> Linux: Run the following in the terminal: for iface in $( ip -o link show | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' ) ; do echo \"Interface: $iface \" ip addr show \" $iface \" | grep -q dynamic && echo \" --> DHCP detected\" || echo \" --> Static or unknown\" done If you see --> DHCP detected , your PC has DHCP enabled and you are ready to continue. If DHCP is disabled, please enable this on your computer. Determining the IP-address Once you have assured that your device is using DHCP, you need to determine which IP-address has been automatically assigned to the Sonar 3D-15 by the Chasing system. Once located, entering it in your browser displays a page like the one below \u2014 in this example, the Sonar 3D-15 is assigned the IP-address 192.168.1.21 . Warning To avoid overheating, do not click the green button \u201cEnable Acoustics\u201d until the ROV is submerged in water. Acoustics is always disabled when first booting up the Sonar 3D-15, and will be turned on once this button is clicked. The Sonar 3D-15 will automatically turn itself off if too hot, but will take some time to cool down, it's best to avoid this happening. Find the IP-address corresponding to the Sonar 3D-15 on a computer by doing the following: Get an overview of the network --> On a computer You need the network IP-address of your computer on the Chasing network. On Linux you find it by typing in: ip a in the terminal. On Windows you find it by typing in: ipconfig Tip It's easier to find your IP-address if your computer is connected only to the Chasing network. A quick easy way to see the IP-addresses of the devices on your local network is to use nmap . Install it for your operating system and go to the terminal and write nmap -sn <YOUR_IP> This will scan the Chasing Wi-Fi and show all accessible connected devices and their IPs. --> On a smartphone WiFiman by Ubiquiti is a good and free option to perform an IP-scan and find all accessible IP-addresses on the network. It can be downloaded from Google Play or Apple Store . Note There are many options of apps and programs that can perform a IP-scan of the network. Fing is another app that works well. Once installed and inside the WiFiman app, go to Discovery and scan the network. A list of all connected devices on the network will show, similar to the following: Test and find the IP-address To find the IP-address of the Sonar 3D-15, try the IP-addresses on the list by typing them into the search bar of your browser.

We recommend that you contact Deep Trekker to purchase the Sonar 3D-15, along with all parts to allow for installation on your Deep Trekker vehicle. You can contact support@deeptrekker.com or sales@deeptrekker.com for this. Other documentation and information can be found at: Deep Trekker PIVOT ROV Support What's in the box The Sonar 3D-15 from Water Linked is normally shipped with an attached I/O Interface board. If you have bought the Sonar 3D-15 and Integration Kit from Deep Trekker, you will have a Deep Trekker (DT9636) connector instead of the I/O Interface. In that case, follow the integration instructions from Deep Trekker. What You\u2019ll Need To follow this guide, you will need the following: An Ethernet cable To connect the Deep Trekker Controller to your PC Correct connector Deep Trekker DT9636 A mount (Sonar 3D-15 to ROV) An example can be downloaded from here: 3D step file Correct screws See the Mounting section Connector Setup Testing the Sonar 3D-15 Separately If the I/O Interface board is attached, the Sonar 3D-15 can be tested directly using an Ethernet cable and a power supply. If you wish to test the device on its own before integration, follow the general Quickstart tutorial, available here: Quickstart . Connecting to Deep Trekker ROV The most common solution is to terminate a Deep Trekker connection port cable (DT9636) directly to the cable of the Sonar 3D-15. To do this, we recommend the following procedure: Remove the I/O board . After this step, the I/O board is no longer needed for normal operation. The cables from the Sonar 3D-15 are shown in the picture below. Terminate a Deep Trekker (DT9636) connection to the Sonar 3D-15 cable using the table and pinmap below.

Note The termination has to be waterproof and needs to withstand the depths of which you will be running your ROV. Mounting The Sonar 3D-15 needs to be physically attached to the Deep Trekker ROV. A possible option on how to do this will be listed here. There are many different approaches to achieve this, and this approach is only listed to provide an idea. Create or find a suitable mount An example 3D step file of a mount is found here: Download 3D step file Note Choose a 3D print material that can withstand the expected operating conditions. Identify the screws and mount to use Use [M4x (5.0 + X) mm] screws to attach the Sonar 3D-15 to the mount, and use [M4x (7.0 + X) mm] screws with hex nuts and washers to attach the mount to the platform in front of the Deep Trekker. Exchange the X with the thickness of your mount. For example, for a 3.0mm thick mount (as the given 3D print) , the following is sufficient: 4x M4x8.0mm screws 4x M4x10.0mm screws 4x M4 Hex Nuts 4x M4 Washers Warning To avoid damaging the Sonar 3D-15, make sure the screws are not too long. Attach the mount to the Sonar 3D-15 Attach the mounted Sonar 3D-15 to the Deep Trekker ROV We recommend putting the Sonar 3D-15 on the platform in the front for the Deep Trekker. In that way, the Sonar 3D-15 can be tilted by using the controller of the ROV, without blocking the Sonar 3D-15\u2019s field of view. Note Make sure the Sonar 3D-15 and cable are neatly and securely attached before use. Connection steps 1. Connect to the bulkhead Connect the Sonar 3D-15 cable into one of your Deep Trekker ROV's free Ethernet ports on the Bulkhead of the DeepTrekker. 2. Connect the top side Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the Deep Trekker controller\u2019s Ethernet port, and the other end to your computer. 3. Turn on the drone Click the power button on the Deep Trekker controller and let the drone boot up. Warning To avoid potential power hazard or errors, make sure all cables are securely connected before you turn on the controller. Do not connect sensors to the Deep Trekker while the power is on. 4. Access the Sonar 3D-15 GUI The Sonar 3D-15 GUI is accessed by entering the Sonar 3D-15's IP-address into the browser running on the computer connected to the controller. Both the PC and Deep Trekker need to have DHCP enabled. This is standard for most computers and is normally enabled. But, to check if your computer has DHCP enabled, do the following: Checking DHCP for Windows: Option 1: Open Settings > Network & Internet . Click on Ethernet Select your active connection. Scroll to IP-address settings: If it says Automatic (DHCP) \u2192 it's enabled. If it says Manual \u2192 DHCP is off. Option 2: Run the following command in the windows terminal ipconfig /all Look for the section Ethernet adapter Ethernet and the line DHCP Enabled (green arrow) If DHCP Enabled is set to Yes , then DHCP is enabled. Checking DHCP for Linux: Run the following in the terminal: for iface in $( ip -o link show | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}' ) ; do echo \"Interface: $iface \" ip addr show \" $iface \" | grep -q dynamic && echo \" --> DHCP detected\" || echo \" --> Static or unknown\" done If you see --> DHCP detected , your PC has DHCP enabled and you are ready to continue. If DHCP is disabled, please enable this on your computer. Finding and connecting to the IP-address of the Sonar 3D-15 You need to determine which IP-address has been automatically assigned to it by the Deep Trekker system. Once located, entering it into your browser will display a page like the one below \u2014 in this example, the Sonar 3D-15 is using 10.77.0.7 . Warning Don't operate the Sonar 3D-15 out of water for any long periods. To avoid overheating of the Sonar 3D-15, don\u2019t click the green button \u201cEnable Acoustics\u201d until the ROV is submerged in water. Acoustics is always disabled when first booting up the Sonar 3D-15, and will be turned on once clicking this button. The Sonar 3D-15 will automatically turn itself off if too hot, but will take some time to cool down, it's best to avoid this happening. To figure out what the correct IP-address is, do the following: Get an overview of the network Click Menu -> Settings -> Network . This will show a list of the IP-addresses of the connected sensors on the DeepTrekker. At this time, the Sonar 3D-15 does not appear in the list, even when connected. Test and find the IP-address The ROV usually assigns connected devices using a base IP-address, in this example, 10.77.0.X . It's possible your ROV has a different base, use the one shown on your Controller. To locate the Sonar 3D-15's IP-address, test an address that doesn't appear in the network list \u2014 preferably one just above the highest one in the list. For example, if the highest IP-address on the list of the Deep Trekker Controller Network section is the DVL A50 with 10.77.0.6 , try accessing the Sonar 3D-15 with 10.77.0.7 or 10.77.0.8 in the browser Or, if all addresses between 10.77.0.1 - 10.77.0.7 are on the list, except for 10.77.0.4 , try the IP-address 10.77.0.4 for the Sonar 3D-15. Tip You can also access the GUI on the Sonar 3D-15's fallback address 192.168.194.96 ,this is explained in more detail in the general Quickstart guide, which can be found at Quickstart . 5. Put the ROV into the water You are now ready to put the ROV into the water. 6. Enable acoustics When ready, click the \u201dStart acoustics\u201d button to initiate the Sonar 3D-15.

Click on a question in the table of content to the right or simply scroll down to read the FAQ's. 1. What is the maximum depth rating of the Sonar 3D-15? The Sonar 3D-15 is rated for depths up to 300\u202fm, ensuring reliable performance in a wide range of underwater environments. 2. What kind of power supply is recommended? We recommend using a power supply capable of delivering 60\u202fW peak (surge) at 10\u201330\u202fV. For optimal performance, a 20\u202fV or higher supply is preferred. 3. Does the Sonar 3D-15 have a thermal shutdown mechanism? Yes. The Sonar 3D-15 includes an internal thermal shutdown to prevent damage to its electronics. You will receive a warning in both the GUI and the API if the internal temperature reaches 55\u202f\u00b0C, indicating that the unit will shut down the acoustic at 60\u202f\u00b0C if it continues to heat up. This will cause you to loose the sonar image. Recommended action: - Once you see the overheat warning (55\u202f\u00b0C), check that the Sonar is in water or cooled in any other way. - If the temperature reaches 70\u202f\u00b0C, the Sonar 3D-15 will shut down to prevent permanent damage and not restart before it reaches 65 \u00b0C again, and it must reach 55 \u00b0C before you will get the sonar image back. 4. What are the default network settings of the Sonar 3D-15? By default, the Sonar 3D-15 uses DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). This means it attempts to get an IP address automatically from a DHCP server on your network. However, the Sonar 3D-15 is always accessible via its fallback IP 192.168.194.96 , even if no DHCP server is present. To use the fallback IP, configure your computer's network interface to an IP address in the 192.168.194.x range (e.g., 192.168.194.90 ) with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 . Can I disable DHCP and set a static IP? Yes, you can disable DHCP in the config settings in the GUI and specify a custom static IP address. This is helpful if you need a fixed IP in your networking environment. 5. Is any software installation required to operate the Sonar 3D-15? No, there is no software installation needed. Once connected and powered on, you can access the Sonar 3D-15\u2019s built-in GUI through a standard web browser. This allows you to operate and configure the sonar without installing any additional software. What if I need custom integration? For advanced integrations, you can use the Sonar 3D-15\u2019s API to develop custom solutions. This requires some programming knowledge but enables control and automation of the Sonar 3D-15\u2019s functionality from your custom system. 6. The performance is not as expected? If the performance is not as expected and you can not find a solution in this documentation, please create a diagnostic log with your Sonar 3D-15 and submit a support ticket with the Sonar 3D diagnostic log file attached.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"sonar-3d/sonar-3d-15-faq/#sonar-3d-15-faq","text":"Below are some frequently asked questions about the Sonar 3D-15.

UDP Multicast data stream Software updates Network configuration Multicast DNS (mDNS) The Sonar 3D-15 runs a DHCP client which will attempt to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server (e.g. in a router) on the same network, and supports mDNS: the mDNS name of the Sonar 3D-15 is waterlinked-sonar . On a computer which supports mDNS, one can then simply access the web GUI at http://waterlinked-sonar . Note If no DHCP server is available on the network, it is recommended to use the fallback IP or configure a static IP address , as the Sonar 3D-15 can spend up to 5 minutes searching for a DHCP server. Fallback IP The Sonar 3D-15 will always be available with the static IP address: 192.168.194.96 . To be able to connect to the Sonar 3D-15 using it: Connect an ethernet cable directly from the Sonar 3D-15 to your computer. For an/the ethernet interface of your computer, configure it to have a static IP address in the same subnet as 192.168.194.96, (e.g. 192.168.194.90) or anything else of the form 192.168.194.xxx if using a subnet of the form 255.255.255.0 (aka 192.168.194.0/24).

The Underwater GPS G2 is a robust and reliable acoustic positioning system with a range of up to 300m (R300 edition). The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, divers and other moving objects below the water surface. Tip We offer a live demo of the GUI of the UGPS G2 system. It runs on simulated data designed to illustrate various GUI features; this data is not necessarily realistic in all aspects! The Underwater GPS G2 system is based upon Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. A locator ( U1 , A1 , or D1 ) is attached to the device to be positioned. It functions as a beacon, sending out acoustic signals. Near the surface, either an antenna containing four receivers is lowered into the water, or four loose receivers are lowered into the water. These listen for the beacon signals. Time-of-flight from the locator to each of the four receivers is used in an innovative algorithm to calculate the position of the locator relative to the UGPS G2 topside unit. We refer to as the acoustic position . The UGPS G2 system obtains a global position by combining this acoustic position with the global GPS coordinates of the topside unit. This may be provided by the topside unit's in-built GPS antenna, or, for greater precision, passed in externally by means of the UGPS G2 API . This API provides output of both the acoustic and global positions calculated by the UGPS G2 system, as well as comprehensive programmatic configuration of the system.

Operation medium The Underwater GPS G2 system is designed only to work in water. It will not work if the locator and/or antenna/receivers are out of water. Max voltage The absolute maximum voltage rating of the equipment is 30V. Voltages above this will damage the electronics. Temperature Make sure the system does not overheat. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight over extended periods of time. Salt water The contents of the topside housing will corrode and/or short if in contact with salt water. Keep the housing lid closed when in the field to avoid salt water getting inside. Force Avoid using excessive force on connectors, screws and other parts of the system, as this can lead to mechanical failure. Locator U1 It will discharge when not in use, so always remember to charge it before operation. See U1 charging procedure. External position and U1 You can use external position data to give a better position estimate, however, if using the U1 the topside will still need GPS lock for time synchronization purposes.

Attach the locator to the unit you want to track (eg. ROV/diver etc.) If using a locator U1, make sure it has GPS lock before it is deployed into water (steady green LED). Open up the GUI and adjust the settings. Make sure to select the correct locator and channel. Configure antenna/receiver placement in the GUI Set heading Tip If you are using a locator U1, make sure it is charged for at least 7 hours with a 5V/2A charger (not a computer) within 24 hours before use, and that it is adjusted to your preferred channel. Channel 3 is usually a good advise. Power on the topside unit Start by connecting power to the UGPS G2 topside box using your prefered power supply . Make sure to place the box where there are good GPS signals. The GPS receiver in the topside box will begin receiving signals and achieve a lock whilst we setup the rest of the system. If you are using the Locator-U1, make sure it is fully charged and set to the chosen channel, then power it on now as well. It too will acquire a GPS lock whilst we setup the rest of the system. If you are inside, use of a GPS repeater or similar will be necessary. Connect to the Underwater GPS topside box Connect to the WiFi access point UnderwaterGPS on your PC/tablet/smartphone. The WiFi password is waterlinked . Navigate to http://192.168.7.1/ in a web browser to access the Underwater GPS web GUI. For alternative ways to connect to the topside, see Networking Deploy locator and antenna/receivers Locator Attach the locator ( U1 , A1 , or D1 ) to your vehicle. The BlueROV2 integration guide may be helpful if integrating an A1 or D1 locator with a vehicle tether. If using an A1 or D1 locator, connect it to the 'Locator' bulkhead on the UGPS G2 topside box. The U1 connector is wireless, which means that this step can be omitted. Antenna Unfold the antenna and lock the mast straight using the latches on the folding joints. Avoid the cable being pinched at the joints. Secure the three arms in place using the thumb screw. Place the antenna in water at the desired location. Secure the Antenna using the RAM Mount components included with the antenna. Connect the antenna to the bulkhead marked 'Receiver 1/Antenna' on the UGPS G2 topside box (see the above picture). Tip If the RAM Mount components included with the antenna do not meet your needs, many alternative RAM Mount Arms and Bases are available . Loose receivers Before deploying the receivers in the water, add a piece of tape to each receiver cable at the desired depth, to make configuration easier. Place the receivers in the water at the desired location, and connect one to each of the four bulkheads 'Receiver 1', 'Receiver 2', 'Receiver 3', and 'Receiver 4' of the UGPS G2 topside box (see the above picture). Tip Add a weight just above each receiver to improve stability in the water. Select locator and channel in the GUI Select the correct locator type in the GUI settings , and choose which channel to listen on. Channel 2 is the default. If using a Locator-U1 , ensure that its channel (set by completely unscrewing the lid and turning the dial inside) is set to the same channel as you configure in the GUI. Note If you are using the Locator-A1, depth information needs to be provided to the topside unit by means of the UGPS API . You can ignore this if following the BlueROV2 integration guide . Configure antenna/receiver placement and search range Provide the correct placement of the antenna/receivers relative to the topside box in the GUI settings , and, if using an antenna, specify if it has been rotated from the default indicated in the GUI. Specifically, for the antenna, enter the position and optionally the rotational angle manually under Advanced settings . If using loose receivers, either drag and drop each receiver to its position, or enter the positions manually. Limit the search area by changing its radius, direction or sector size in the GUI Tip Reducing the search area can improve the performance of the system, and we recommend to do this as far as possible, even if operating in a small area such as a tank or pool. Set heading In the top bar of the GUI you will see a warning about missing heading. Click the link, click to zero the gyros, then set compass heading to a reference heading (e.g. from an analogue compass, compass app, or boat compass). Note The topside does not have an integrated compass. An IMU will keep track of the heading based on the initially stated heading in the configuration. In a static environment setting the heading once will be enough, but in a more dynamic environment the IMU will drift over time and the heading will need a regular update. If operating in more demanding environments it is recommended to use an external compass to keep the heading updated. Info Setting the heading replaces IMU calibration as of release 3.3.0.

The heading are drifting rapidly In dynamic environments, such as in a boat at sea with rapid change of angles, the heading has to be set frequently in Settings . In harsh wether this has to be done up to every minute. In such conditions it is advised to use an external compass to get accurate positioning data from the UGPS. If the UGPS is permanently installed on one boat, the boats compass can be used. Otherwise an external portable compass can be implemented. 2. Can I set the speed of sound? Yes, If you have the R300 version you can set the speed of sound in the \"settings\" menu in the GUI. Note If you have the R100 version you can't change the speed of sound. The option to change the speed of sound is still present, but you will get an error message saying \"Bad request\" 3. My UGPS system are not performing well If your UGPS system does not perform as expected, you should contact Waterlinkes tecnical support team through the support portal in Waterlinked's home pages on the internet. To help the support team analyzing your systems behaviour, you should record a diagnostic logfile. This can easily be done by opening the Diagnostics window in the UGPS GUI. At the bottom of the page there is an option that allows you to record a diagnostic report. The file should preferably be recorded in the moment or circumstance as your system is failing.

My UGPS system are not performing well"},{"location":"underwater-gps/ugps-sys-setup/","text":"How to install your system Topside The topside should be placed outdoors with an open view to the sky, to easily achieve GPS lock. The forward direction og the topside box should be in the whatever direction you define as forward. If you are using an antenna, make sure the forward direction of the antenna aligns with the forward direction of the topside. If one a boat, typically forward aligns with the boats heading. Antenna The antenna can be placed anywhere up to 10m from the topside housing (limited by cable length). Make sure it's forward direction aligns with the forward direction of the topside box. If this is not possible, make sure you enter the deviation in the Baseline settings in the GUI. See System Configuration Tip By the antenna base is meant the joining point of the three prongs with the receivers at their ends. Alignment Ensure that the 'Forward' direction of the antenna as defined by a label on one of its prongs (see also the figure below) is aligned with the 'Forward' direction of the topside housing (indicated by a label on the lid). If it is not possible to physically align them, in Baseline -> Antenna configuration -> Advanced settings , specify the clockwise angle in degrees from the forward axis of the topside to the forward axis of the antenna. If this alignment is not carried out, the global position outputted by UGPS G2 will be incorrect. Line-of-sight Ensure that there will be line-of-sight between the antenna and locator. Antenna depth Ensure that the base of the antenna is at a depth of at least one metre (as indicated by a label upon the top folding joint of the pole of the antenna), to avoid acoustic disturbance. The depth of the antenna base (relative to the sea surface) must be specified in Baseline -> Antenna configuration -> Advanced settings -> Antenna depth . If it is not, both the acoustic and global positions may be incorrect. Antenna stability Secure the antenna tightly to the vessel using the provided Ram Mount. Note Directivity : the antenna and locators are omnidirectional, that is, signal strength should be good in all directions Receivers Loose receivers can be placed anywhere up to 100m from the topside housing. Go through the following, and configure the placement of the receivers in the graphical pane at Baseline -> Receiver and range configuration so that their positions relative to the origin and their depths are correct. See System Configuration Line-of-sight Ensure that all the receivers will have line-of-sight to the locator. Separation Ensure that the receivers are not too close, and are not all in a line. A grid of 2x2 metres should typically be sufficient for good performance, but experiment with different configurations if you experience sub-optimal performance.

The locator is attached with a mounting bracket included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit. Open the electronics enclosure To open the electronics enclosure, you will need the following parts and tools: 2.5 mm hex key Large flat head screwdriver (optional) To ensure your ROV is completely powered off, please remove the battery completely from the 3\u201d enclosure and place to the side. Unscrew the M3x16 screws that mount the electronics enclosure to the ROV cradle (in the front and in the back). The number of screws depends on the model version of your ROV. Remove the Vent Plug from the Vent Penetrator Bolt on the electronics enclosure. Remove the 4\u2033 tube and forward dome assembly from the rear end cap by sliding it forward. A large flat head screw driver can help to do that. Replace blank penetrator with Locator-A1 penetrator To remove a blank penetrator and install the cable of the Locator-A1 into the end cap, you will need the following parts and tools: Locator-A1 M10-6.5mm-LC WetLink Penetrator from Blue Robotics Silicone Grease Isopropyl Alcohol Wipe WetLink Bulkhead Wrench M10 from Blue Robotics WetLink Penetrator Assembly Block and a vice to secure it (optional) WetLink Penetrator Plug Wrench 14mm and a A 1/4 inch (6.3mm) square drive ratchet or torque wrench (optional) Cable jacket stripper , a utility knife, or a sharp blade Cutting pliers Remove the blank penetrator as pictured from the 4\u201d End Cap with the penetrator bulkhead wrench. Cut the cable of the Locator-A1 to the correct length with cutting pliers considering that about 15 cm of cable are needed inside the enclosure. For the recommended mounting position you need a length of around 70 cm. Double check that this is sufficient for your mounting position. Remove 10 cm of the cable jacket using a cable jacket stripper, a utility knife, or a sharp blade. Cut off everything except the twisted pair of wires using cutting pliers. Follow the Blue Robotics WetLink Penetrator Assembly Guide and install the WetLink penetrator onto the Locator-A1 cable. Wipe the exterior surface of the electronics enclosure end cap clean with an isopropyl alcohol wipe, and make sure it is free of any particles in the areas where the penetrator O-ring will sit. Remove the O-ring from the bag and apply silicone grease to it. Install the O-ring onto the WetLink penetrator. Install the WetLink penetrator with the Locator-A1 cable onto the end cap in the hole you previously removed a blank penetrator from. Tighten to finger tight, then use the bulkhead wrench to tighten it an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can\u2019t loosen it with your fingers, it is tight enough. Connect Locator-A1 wires to ROV tether One pair of twisted wires from the Locator-A1 (blue/white) must be connected to a spare twisted pair on the BlueROV2 tether. To solder the wires together you will need: A soldering iron and solder A utility knife, or a sharp blade Heat shrink tube Hot air gun (optional) Note Alternatively to soldering you can use your favorite headers to establish an electrical connection. Remove 5mm wire insulation on both the tether wires and the locator wires with a knife. Put heat shrink tube onto the wires before soldering. Connect the Locator-A1 wires (blue/white) to a spare twisted pair of the tether (recommended: green/white) by soldering. Pull the the heat shrink tube over the solder-connection and shrink it with a hot air gun or alternatively with your soldering iron turned to low. Reassemble BlueROV2 Electronics Enclosure To reassemble your BlueROV2 Electronics Enclosure, you will need the following parts and tools: M3x16 screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly (number depends on your BlueROV version) Silicone Grease 2.5 mm hex key Reinstall 4\u201d Watertight Enclosure onto ROV with the following steps: Apply silicone grease to the two radial O-rings on the O-Ring Flange (4\u201d Series) that is attached to the Electronics Tray. Then slide the Watertight Enclosure (4\u201d Series) with installed Dome End Cap over the electronics tray and the O-Ring Flange (4\u201d Series) while trying to align the clips for the screws in the front and back. Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). This allows clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series) easily. Mount the Locator-A1 to the BlueROV2 frame To mount the Locator-A1 to the BlueROV2 frame, you will need the following parts and tools: Locator-A1 mounting bracket (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) rubber pad (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) 2 M4x35 Socket head cap screws (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) 2 M4 Lock Nuts (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) 3 mm hex key 7 mm spanner or wrench 4 mm drill bit Route the locator cable to one side of the ROV. The below picture illustrates the recommended mounting position. Your mounting bracket might look differently. Find an appropriate spot to attach the Locator-A1 mounting bracket to the frame of the BlueROV2. Drill out two holes spaced 49.25 mm apart using a 4 mm drill bit. Wrap the locator in the rubber pad before inserting into the mounting bracket. Attach the Locator-A1 to the Locator-A1 mounting bracket, and secure the bracket to the BlueROV2 using the M4x35 Socket head cap screws and lock nuts. Modifications to the UGPS Topside In the following steps you will upgrade your UGPS G2 Topside with Powerline communication (PLC) capabilities to communicate directly with the BlueROV2. In order to do that, you will need the following parts and tools: UGPS G2 Topside Ethernet cable (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) Powerline communication (PLC) module LX200V30 (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) Soldering iron Connect Ethernet cable Locate the ethernet ports on the Interface Electronics board and the Master Electronics board. Connect the included Ethernet cable to the two ports. Install the PLC module In this step the the Powerline communication (PLC) module is installed on the Interface Electronics board. What do the LEDs on the PLC module mean? LED Definition Function 1 Power Lights when the PLC module has power 2 Ethernet Flashes when there is data flow from Master Electronics 3 PLC Lights when a link is established with FXTI or BlueROV2 Locate the socket for the PLC module on the Interface board. Press the PLC module into the socket, making sure that the press-fit standoffs latch into the holes in the Interface Electronics board. Modify Interface Electronics Note This step is only necessary for Underwater GPS G2 bought before June 2021. For units produced after June 2021, this step is not necessary. Warning Skipping this step leaves a regulated 12V power source from the Underwater GPS on the PLC lines (pins 1 (GND) and 2 (12V) on the Locator bulkhead connector). Connecting non-isolated equipment to the PLC lines may damage the Underwater GPS or any external equipment. Note Locator-D1 cannot be used unless the resistors are soldered back on to the Interface Electronics. The Interface Electronics board in the Underwater GPS housing comes with resistors R2 and R3 which put GND on pin 1 and 12V on pin 2 of the bulkhead connector with the label \u201cLocator\u201d. The configuration of the FXTI, BlueROV2 and the Underwater GPS G2 are affected by leaving these resistors on the board, so they must be removed for normal operation. Remove the resistors with a soldering iron. Modifications to the FXTI In this step the FXTI will be modified to firstly connect the analog signal of the Locator-A1 between the ROV tether and the UGPS Topside. Secondly the UGPS Topside is connected to the existing communication wires between the BlueROV and the FXTI electronics (Powerline Ethernet signals). A high level diagram of how this will look is shown below. In order to make these connections, you will need the following parts and tools: Binder-connector-pigtail-assembly (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) A female-to-female jumper wire, white/green (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) 2 mm hex key Unscrew the connector panel from the FXTI with the hex key and remove one of the black plastic plugs from one of the auxiliary ports. Thread the Binder-connector-pigtail-assembly into the open port and secure in place with the included bulkhead nut. Connect the green and white twisted pair of the tether connector to the brown and brown/white pair on the new Binder-connector-pigtail-assembly with the included female-to-female jumper wire. Connect the blue and white twisted pair of the Binder-connector-pigtail-assembly to the FXTI Tether Connection PCB, matching the orientation of the pre-installed blue and white wire connections. Reassemble the FXTI box. Establish a network connection between UGPS Topside, BlueROV2 and topside computer Now that all hardware modifications are done, you will connect UGPS Topside, FXTI/BlueROV2 and topside computer and test the network connection. Power up the BlueROV. Connect the BlueROV with the tether to the FXTI. Connect the FXTI with the USB-cable to the computer. FXTI USB port Your topside computer may have a USB port which permits higher than default (which is 500mA) current. Such ports are typically marked with a lightning or battery symbol. Also USB 3.0 ports (blue plastic) provide higher current. If available, we recommend use of one of these for plugging in the FXTI, as this can improve performance. Set your topside computer to have a static IP address of 192.168.2.1 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. The BlueROV2 typically has IP address 192.168.2.2, so you probably already have this set up. Make sure your firewall allows QGroundControl to communicate with the network. Look at the Network Setup steps at Blue Robotics if you need more details. Set the IP switch inside the UGPS Topside unit to 192.168.2.94 (the down position). This equips the G2 topside unit with the static IP address 192.168.2.94. Connect the Binder-connector named \"Locator\" at the UGPS Topside with the newly installed Binder-connector at the FXTI using the deck extension cable, which came with the BlueROV integration kit. (Power up the UGPS Topside)[https://waterlinked.github.io/underwater-gps/power-supply/]. It is on when the power button is lit. You should now be able to access both the BlueROV by typing 192.168.2.2 in your browser address line and UGPS Topside by typing 192.168.2.94 . Both have to be turned on.

Most common integration methods We recommend you to use the Locator-A1 together with the BlueROV2 Integration Kit when integrating the UGPS system with the BlueROV2. The integration steps are described in BlueROV2 Integration Locator-A1 . Hardware modification must be carried out on the ROV, FXTI and UGPS Topside which serve two purposes: Firstly, a spare twisted wire pair in the tether is used to connect the Locator-A1 to the UGPS Topside. Secondly, the UGPS Topside is modified to connect directly to the communication between ROV and topside computer. The advantage of integrating using this method is that there is no additional topside computer configuration required, which can be challenging with different operating systems (i.e. Linux, iOS). If you wish to avoid carrying out hardware changes to the ROV, as they are required to integrate the A1-Locator, then we recommend you to use the Locator-U1 . The locator can simply be attached to the BlueROV2 in any convenient way. However some configuration steps in the topside computer are required to establish a network bridge, so the position calculated by the UGPS Topside is available in QGroundControl. These steps are described in BlueROV2 Integration Locator-U1 . Be aware that setting up a network bridge in operating systems other than Windows can be challenging. Alternative integration methods If you wish to use a Locator-A1 , however you wish to avoid purchasing the full integration kit then this can be done. The Locator-A1 must be installed on the ROV and connected to the G2 Topside and then it is necessary to set-up a network bridge.

BlueROV Software Update and UGPS extension Your BlueROV2 runs BlueOS This section is for the R4 version of the BlueROV2 that uses the Navigator Flight Controller or ROVs that have been upgraded to BlueOS software. Info If you have an older R1, R2, or R3 version of the BlueROV2 that uses a Pixhawk autopilot and you want to upgrade to using BlueOS, you can either carry out a software upgrade only (described here) or upgrade the hardware from Pixhawk to Navigator flight controller and the software (described here) . The Water Linked UGPS system requires an extension in BlueOS to be able to communicate with the autopilot (Pixhawk or Navigator flight controller). BlueOS has to be updated to BlueOS 1.1.0 or newer to assure that extensions are supported sufficiently. Follow the Update Software section of the BlueROV Software Setup guide To enable the UGPS extension navigate to \"Extensions\", that should show up in the side bar after the above described BlueOS update. Click on the \"Water Linked UGPS\" extension. In the pop-up make sure the latest version (> 1.0.4) is selected and click \"Install\". The extension should show up in the \"Installed\" tab. Your BlueROV2 runs Ardusub Companion This section is for older R1, R2, or R3 versions of the BlueROV2 that use a Pixhawk autopilot and Companion software. To work properly, the Water Linked UGPS system requires ArduSub Companion image version 0.0.21 or newer and the most recent stable release of QGroundControl for your operating system. If your Companion image is out of date, please follow the BlueROV2 Software Update procedures . Note No special extension for the UGPS system is necessary in Companion OS. It is natively supported. Checking UGPS to autopilot connection on land If you open QGroundControl you should be able to establish a connection to the ROV as before UGPS integration. Furthermore you should be able to see messages of type GPS_INPUT in the MAVLink Inspector (click on Q-logo, then Analyze Tools, then MAVLink Inspector in sidebar). This is the MAVLink message that is provided by the UGPS BlueROV Extension to the autopilot (Pixhawk or Navigator flight controller). For detailed information about the extension see the BlueOS Extension for UGPS GitHub page . Daily operation This section will help you if a UGPS system was already integrated with the BlueROV2 and you want to use and not also install it. Follow the instructions of the UGPS Quickstart-Guide from the Water Linked Documentation for antenna or loose receivers deployment. Connect BlueROV2, FXTI, topside computer and UGPS Topside and assure the network connection is working: For the Locator-A1, follow this section For the Locator-U1, follow this section . In addition, note the channel setting in the Locator-U1 and close the lid to power it up. Follow the steps of the Quickstart-Guide from the Water Linked Documentation for: Selecting the locator in the GUI Configuring antenna/receiver placement and search range. Setting of heading. Start QGroundControl and verify the connection to the BlueROV2. Even if the ROV can not have a location fix above water it should now receive data from the UGPS system. See Checking UGPS to autopilot connection on land Dive the BlueROV2 so the Locator is submerged a few centimeters below the surface. If everything is operating correctly, you should now find a ROV position on the map in QGroundControl. The ROV position is indicated by a BlueROV2 image. The position of the surface vessel or Water Linked UGPS Topside housing is indicated by a red arrow or Q-symbol depending of QGroundControl version. The small \u2018H\u2019 icon indicates the \u2018home position\u2019, the location of the ROV\u2019s first GPS lock. UGPS Topside position The UGPS topside position is not shown reliably on all systems. It is sent as NMEA to UDP port 14401, so check your configuration in QGroundControl. Troubleshooting 'No External Depth' error in UGPS Topside GUI, or QGroundControl connection issues (for Ardusub Companion) This almost certainly means that the network between the UGPS G2 topside and the BlueROV2 has not been successfully established. First carry out the following steps: Ensure you are using the latest versions of ArduSub Companion and QGroundControl: Update Software In the Companion Web Interface, go to the MAVProxy page: http://192.168.2.2:2770/mavproxy Click on the \u201cRestore Default Options\u201d button. Power cycle the BlueROV2. Check the PLC LED (3) on the PLC module (see box \"What do the LEDs on the PLC module mean?\") If the issue persists, if you are using the FXTI approach to the networking, you may wish to try the network bridge approach, as the FTXI sometimes fails to handle the connections satisfactorily. In addition, double-check that you did not skip the Modifications to the FXTI . If none of this solves the problem, you are very welcome to contact us , and we will be happy to support you. Connection to BlueROV2 lost when connecting Underwater GPS to FXTI The current draw by the FXTI can exceed 500 mA when connecting the Underwater GPS to the PLC network. This can then cause the FXTI to become unstable if it's connected to a standard USB 2.0 port on the computer since USB 2.0 allows for a maximum of 500 mA current draw. There are two known solutions: Connect the USB cable of the FXTI to a USB 3.0/3.1 compatible USB-A port. USB 3.0/3.1 allows for a maximum of 900 mA current draw. A USB 3.0/3.1 compatible USB-A port should be recognized by its blue plastic parts. Add a separate power source to the Fathom-X inside the FXTI. The Fathom-X board has screw terminals marked BATT which can attach to a 7-28V DC power source. Water Linked software updates Keep the Water Linked software up to date .

See Networking for details on how to connect to the UGPS's GUI. The Underwater GPS GUI is web based. Using your favorite web browser, go the IP address as defined here . We currently support and recommend Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. Attention Internet Explorer is not supported as of now. Tip We offer a live demo of the GUI of the UGPS G2 system. It runs on simulated data, designed to illustrate various GUI features; this data is not necessarily realistic in all aspects! The system does not need to be fully set up to access the user interface. Only the topside needs to be powered on. You will however get some status warnings as long as the topside is not able to detect any locator. The first thing you see when opening up the GUI is the Position window with the relative position view, and the status warnings. To the left there is a menu bar where you can access all features and settings. Note For more information about the warnings, see: warnings Position This window shows you the werabouts of the locator in relation to the topside. You can switch between relative position and map position. Note You will need internet access on the computer that are showing the GUI, if you also want to see the map and not only the relative position of the locator. This is because the map is fetched from the internet. Relative position The relative position view shows you the location of the locator in relation to the UGPS topside box. Map position To be able to get a map position view, your computer must have internet access, as the map is downloaded from the internet. The map view gives you the position and heading of the topside and the position of the locator. In this view you can also mark your own points of interests , either if you know the latitude and longitude of the destination you seek, or if you want to mark a point you pass along the route so that you can go back later. Baseline The baseline is the configuration of your systems settings based on your hardware setup. In this window you select your baseline setup, whether you are using an antenna or loose receivers, and their placement with regard to the topside. In the tab at the top select antenna or receivers according to whether an antenna or loose receivers are used, and enter your systems baseline configurations. See System configurations for details on how to configure your systems baseline in the GUI. Settings In Settings, you configure which locator you are using and if your topside is statically mounted on a dock or if it is onboard a boat. If you are using a locator-U1, you need to configure which channel the locator is on. If the topside is mounted in a dynamic environment, you will get the option to set your systems heading. In this case you must use a good compass and enter the heading into your system regularly. The compass of a mobile phone is not accurate enough. You can also choose if you want to use metric or imperial units. In the advanced settings option you can choose your preferred connection method. Note Remeber that the locator channel has to be set both in the settings menu, and also physically on the locator-U1. See System configurations for details on how to configure your systems settings in the GUI. Diagnostics In the Diagnostic window you can see the locator position in numbers, together with a graphical view of the signal strength and system noise. This allows you to analyse your systems performance. In the diagnostic plot you should see the signal from all 4 Receivers. The signals should be well above the noise floor. Interference Acoustic interference can be observed in the diagnostic plot. Echo sounders from your boat or nearby boats typically appears like burst noise. If it is coming from your boat, try to turn off the echo sounder to improve position accuracy. In case of interference from other acoustic sources, use the GUI to try other channels to avoid the interference. Tip Typically, NSD ( Noise spectral density ) is around -100 dBm (in the units of version 3.3.0 or later of the software; 15 nV/sqrt(Hz) in the units of earlier software versions), or a little higher or lower. If it is much higher than this, it is likely that there is acoustic interference in the chosen channel, and a different channel should be tried. Note in particular that acoustic devices quite commonly operate at frequencies lying in Channel 1. Tip If the NSD values are normal, signal quality is mainly indicated by the RSSI values (_Received signal strength indicator). As long as the RSSI values are not too far below the NSD values, the signal strength should be at usable levels. The UGPS system uses advanced signal processing techniques and can work even with rather weak signals, but an RSSI of -125 dBm or so (in the units of version 3.3.0 or later of the software; -45 dBnW in the units of earlier software versions) is around the lowest possible for an NSD of roughly -100 dBm. Typically one can expect a decrease in signal strength of around 6 dB for each doubling of distance due to spherical spreading, plus a little more due to additional absorption. Diagnostic report At the bottom of the page there is an option that allows you to record a diagnostic report. If you are experienceing any issues with your system, record a diagnostic logfile. The file should preferably be recorded in the moment as your system is failing. Then contact Waterlinkeds technical support through the support portal . Attach the diagnostic report file you recorded to your request. The file contains valuable information that will help the support team analyse your system. Note The logfile must be downloaded to your computer and sent to customer support as an email attachment. About The about page tells you which software version that is currently running on your system. If there is a new update available you can easily download and install from this page. But the topside must be turned on and connected to the internet for this option to be available. If not you will have to do a manual upgrade. See Software update for details on how to do this. It is always recommended to use the latest sw update. Tip If a new software update is available, an exclamation mark will be visible next to the Waterlinked logo in the GUI.","title":"GUI"},{"location":"underwater-gps/interface/ugps-gui/#ugps-gui","text":"The UGPS comes with an easy to use Graphical User Interface that can easily be reached via wifi or ethernet.

This allows you to analyse your systems performance. In the diagnostic plot you should see the signal from all 4 Receivers. The signals should be well above the noise floor.","title":"Diagnostics"},{"location":"underwater-gps/interface/ugps-gui/#interference","text":"Acoustic interference can be observed in the diagnostic plot. Echo sounders from your boat or nearby boats typically appears like burst noise. If it is coming from your boat, try to turn off the echo sounder to improve position accuracy. In case of interference from other acoustic sources, use the GUI to try other channels to avoid the interference. Tip Typically, NSD ( Noise spectral density ) is around -100 dBm (in the units of version 3.3.0 or later of the software; 15 nV/sqrt(Hz) in the units of earlier software versions), or a little higher or lower. If it is much higher than this, it is likely that there is acoustic interference in the chosen channel, and a different channel should be tried. Note in particular that acoustic devices quite commonly operate at frequencies lying in Channel 1. Tip If the NSD values are normal, signal quality is mainly indicated by the RSSI values (_Received signal strength indicator). As long as the RSSI values are not too far below the NSD values, the signal strength should be at usable levels. The UGPS system uses advanced signal processing techniques and can work even with rather weak signals, but an RSSI of -125 dBm or so (in the units of version 3.3.0 or later of the software; -45 dBnW in the units of earlier software versions) is around the lowest possible for an NSD of roughly -100 dBm. Typically one can expect a decrease in signal strength of around 6 dB for each doubling of distance due to spherical spreading, plus a little more due to additional absorption.","title":"Interference"},{"location":"underwater-gps/interface/ugps-gui/#diagnostic-report","text":"At the bottom of the page there is an option that allows you to record a diagnostic report.

Description The Locator-U1 is a battery-powered, digital hydroacoustic locator device. It includes an internal GPS-based time-sync module, eliminating the need for a tether. This makes it ideal for divers, ROVs lacking convenient power sources, or other underwater applications. Before deployment, the Locator-U1 must obtain a GPS lock. The integrated status LED indicates the lock status. Once locked, the Locator-U1 can operate for around 6 hours before it needs to resync with GPS. A rotary switch is located inside the cap, allowing you to select the channel on which the Locator transmits. The same channel must be set in the Water Linked Underwater GPS GUI. Each side of the Locator has three M3 mounting holes, and a standard bracket is included. Note You will need GPS lock on the topside as well when using the U1. This is for timing purposes, it will not help to use only external GPS position as this can not be used for time synchronization. It is not enough to only have GPS lock on the U1. Charging The Locator-U1 has an internal rechargeable battery. Use the included USB-C cable and a 5\u202fV / 2\u202fA (or higher) wall adapter to charge it. The U1 will require to be fully charged before each operation as it will discharge over time when left with the cap off. Depending on the age of the U1 and the temperature in the environment the discharging effect will be worse. Note Do not use your computer to charge the locator, the computers USB port does not supply enough power to charge the locator. Charge for at least 7 hours. Note that a steady green light only indicates gps lock, and has nothing to do with the charging status. 1) Insert the USB-C cable Plug one end of the cable into the Locator-U1\u2019s charging port. 2) Connect to a suitable power source Attach the other end of the cable to a wall adapter providing at least 5V/2A. Avoid charging from a computer USB port. 3) Charge for 7 hours Leave the Locator-U1 connected for a full 7 hours to ensure a complete charge. You can then disconnect the cable and use the Locator-U1. Charging overnight the night before use is a recommended routine. LED Behavior While Charging When the Locator-U1 is connected to a charger, the LED does not indicate charging progress. You may see: 1) Blinking green LED The Locator-U1 is powered on and functioning normally (such as searching for GPS). This does not reflect charging status. 2) No LED (off) The battery is too low to power on, but the device is still charging. Once it has enough power, the LED will start blinking. 3) Solid green LED The Locator-U1 is powered on and has a GPS lock (see LED Signals ). This does not mean it is fully charged. Keep charging for the full 7-hour period. Warning Do not charge the Locator-U1 using a computer USB port. Powering On and Off To power on the Locator-U1, securely tighten the lid over the charging port. The LED will begin blinking to indicate that it is searching for a GPS lock. Once the LED stops blinking and becomes solid, the Locator-U1 has acquired a GPS lock and is ready for use. Ensure the O-ring on the lid is undamaged before submerging the device. To power off the Locator-U1, unscrew the back lid until the LED turns off. LED Signals No green light Power is off; the Locator-U1 is not ready for diving.
